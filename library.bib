  abstract = {The spatial distribution of red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus Oliv. in coconut plantations was studied by applying a series of statistical tests. Population dispersion parameters and also different dispersion indices were calculated for monthly weevil counts obtained through 40 pheromone (Ferrolure+) trap captures, between August, 1999 and July, 2000. The dispersion parameters, viz. mean-variance test, clumping parameter (K) and statistic t tests revealed that red palm weevil population followed the negative binomial distribution pattern and was highly aggregated or clumped. Further, the different dispersion indices, viz. variance to mean ratio, Cole's index, David and Moore's index, 'K' of negative binomial and Lloyd's index of mean crowding went on to confirm the aggregated or contagious distribution pattern of red palm weevil. Due to the clumped nature of palm weevil population, these results emphasize the need of adopting preventive management practices in and around plantations infested by red palm weevil. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Abstract The advent of simple and affordable tools for molecular identification of novel insect invaders and assessment of population diversity has changed the face of invasion biology in recent years. The widespread application of these tools has brought with it an emerging understanding that patterns in biogeog- raphy, introduction history and subsequent movement and spread of many invasive alien insects are far more complex than previously thought. We reviewed the literature and found that for a number of invasive insects, there is strong and growing evidence that multiple introductions, complex global movement, and population admixture in the invaded range are commonplace. Additionally, historical paradigms related to species and strain identities and origins of common invaders are in many cases being challenged. This has major consequences for our understanding of basic biology and ecology of invasive insects and impacts quarantine, management and biocontrol pro- grams. In addition, we found that founder effects rarely limit fitness in invasive insects and may benefit populations (by purging harmful alleles or increasing additive genetic variance). Also, while phenotypic plasticity appears important post-establishment, genetic diversity in invasive insects is often higher than expected and increases over time via multiple introductions. Further, connectivity among disjunct regions of global invasive ranges is generally far higher than expected and is often asymmetric, with some populations contributing disproportionately to global spread.Weargue that the role of connectivity in driving the ecology and evolution of introduced species with multiple invasive ranges has been histor- ically underestimated and that such species are often best understood in a global context.},

The reason why some species become successful invaders, whereas others, even closely related species, remain noninvasive is often unclear. The harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis, introduced for biological pest control, has become an invader that is outcompeting indigenous ladybird species in many countries. Here, we show that Harmonia carries abundant spores of obligate parasitic microsporidia closely related to Nosema thompsoni. These microsporidia, while not harming the carrier Harmonia, are lethal pathogens for the native ladybird Coccinella septempunctata. We propose that intraguild predation, representing a major selective force among competing ladybird species, causes the infection and ultimate death of native ladybirds when they feed on microsporidia-contaminated Harmonia eggs or larvae.},

First detected in 1997 in southern Portugal, it has spread into south-west Spain including Do\~nana National Park. Its impact on native taxa in the same area is unclear, but it is the dominant species in several permanent, saline wetlands.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated whether the ecophysiology of this alien species favours its spread in the Iberian Peninsula and its relative success in saline areas. We compared physiological responses to heating (Critical Thermal maximum), cooling (Critical Thermal minimum) and freezing (Super Cooling Point) in the native Sigara lateralis and introduced T. v. verticalis acclimated to different temperatures and salinities. The larger S. lateralis generally outperformed T. v. verticalis and appeared to possess a broader thermal tolerance range. In both taxa, CTmax was highest in animals exposed to a combination of high conductivities and relatively low acclimation temperatures. However, CTmax was generally higher in T. v. verticalis and lower in S. lateralis when acclimated at higher temperatures. CTmin were lower (greater tolerance to cold) after acclimation to high conductivities in T. v. verticalis, and following acclimation to low conductivities in S. lateralis. Both acclimation temperature and conductivity influenced corixids' freezing tolerance; however, only in T. v. verticalis did SCP decrease after exposure to both high temperature and conductivity. T. v. verticalis showed a higher range of mean responses over all treatments.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: Whilst the native S. lateralis may have a broader thermal range, the alien species performs particularly well at higher salinities and temperatures and this ability may facilitate its invasion in Mediterranean areas. The greater plasticity of T. v. verticalis may further facilitate its spread in the future, as it may be more able to respond to climate shifts than the native species.},

  abstract = {This research seeks to use extensive home sale and socioeconomic data, coupled with urban tree cover data to identify the influence of urban trees on house values, estimate the demand for urban trees and ultimately calculate the welfare change of forest loss in California, with a two-stage hedonic price model. In the first stage model, we detected spatial dependence using the Lagrange-Multiplier Robust tests and found significant spatial correlations in house prices for each of five California counties. Our identification strategy relies on flexibly controlling for unobserved spatial effects by using the Spatial Lag Model (SAR) to get consistent estimates of urban tree cover. The SAR model solves the problem by establishing the spatial weight matrix to incorporate the neighboring house price. In the second stage, we then used market segmentation to identify the demand parameters by collecting data from five geographic markets, assuming that residents in each market share common preference structures. Consequently, the first-stage analysis provides evidence of positive effect of tree cover on home values, which is robust with different specifications. We further found that the estimated own price elasticity of demand for tree cover within each parcel was - 0.075, suggesting an inelastic demand curve.},

Currently they are three priority medications for malaria prophylaxis to West Africa: mefloquine, atovaquone/proguanil and doxycycline.

We used a decision tree model and made a literature research on the components of travel related malaria. The main outcome measure was the cost effectiveness of malaria chemoprophylaxis reimbursement based on malaria and deaths averted.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nRESULTS: Using a program where travellers would be reimbursed for 80\% of the cost of the cheapest malaria chemoprophylaxis is dominant (i.e. cost saving and more effective than the current situation) using the assumption that currently 68.7\% of travellers to West Africa use malaria chemoprophylaxis. If the current usage of malaria chemoprophylaxis would be higher, 82.4\%, the incremental cost per malaria case averted is \texteuro{} 2'302. The incremental cost of malaria death averted is \texteuro{} 191'833.The most important factors influencing the model were: the proportion of travellers using malaria chemoprophylaxis, the probability of contracting malaria without malaria chemoprophylaxis, the cost of the mefloquine regimen, the decrease in the number of travellers without malaria chemoprophylaxis in the reimbursement strategy.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a reimbursement of 80\% of the cost of the cheapest effective malaria chemoprophylaxis (mefloquine) for travellers from Switzerland to West Africa is highly effective in terms of malaria cases averted and is cost effective to the Swiss health system. These data are relevant to discussions about the cost effectiveness of malaria chemoprophylaxis reimbursement for vulnerable groups such as those visiting friends and relatives who have the highest risk of malaria, who are least likely to use chemoprophylaxis.},

  abstract = {Biosecurity agencies need robust bioeconomic tools to help inform policy and allocate scarce management resources. They need to estimate the potential for each invasive alien species (IAS) to create negative impacts, so that relative and absolute comparisons can be made. Using pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa sensu lato) as an example, these needs were met by combining species niche modelling, dispersal modelling, host impact and economic modelling. Within its native range (the Mediterranean Basin and adjacent areas), T. pityocampa causes significant defoliation of pines and serious urticating injuries to humans. Such severe impacts overseas have fuelled concerns about its potential impacts, should it be introduced to New Zealand. A stochastic bioeconomic model was used to estimate the impact of PPM invasion in terms of pine production value lost due to a hypothetical invasion of New Zealand by T. pityocampa. The bioeconomic model combines a semi-mechanistic niche model to develop a climate-related damage function, a climate-related forest growth model, and a stochastic spread model to estimate the present value (PV) of an invasion. Simulated invasions indicate that Thaumetopoea pityocampa could reduce New Zealand's merchantable and total pine stem volume production by 30\%, reducing forest production by between NZ\$1,550 M to NZ\$2,560 M if left untreated. Where T. pityocampa is controlled using aerial application of an insecticide, projected losses in PV were reduced, but still significant (NZ\$30 M to NZ\$2,210 M). The PV estimates were more sensitive to the efficacy of the spray program than the potential rate of spread of the moth. Our novel bioeconomic method provides a refined means of estimating potential impacts of invasive alien species, taking into account climatic effects on asset values, the potential for pest impacts, and pest spread rates.},

We found that higher temperatures have significant direct effects on the growth rate of mealybug colony, and the positive effect of ant tending on mealybug colony growth is temperature-dependent. Honeydew excretion by mealybugs was affected by ant tending and temperature warming, and was significantly increased under higher temperature. The effect of ant tending on percentage parasitism was also influenced by temperature warming. Ant performance including tending level, aggression, activity, and honeydew consumption was enhanced by temperature warming, which may provide superior protection to the mealybugs. Our results show that ghost ant-mealybug mutualism is strengthened in a warmer environment.

  abstract = {As an increasing proportion of the global human population resides in urban areas, urban forests are becoming both more important and more threatened. In many cities urban tree cover conflicts with strategies for urban intensification, and is being reduced due to inadequate protection. Here, we assess the effectiveness of one type of tree protection policy used by a number of cities worldwide: the case-by-case protection of specific individual trees. We use Auckland, New Zealand as a case study, where the main form of urban tree protection is now through Auckland Council's Schedule of Notable Trees. We investigated: (1) the species composition of the listed trees, and (2) the relative contribution of geographical variables (suburb age, dwelling density, socio-economic deprivation, and tree cover) in explaining spatial variation in listed-tree density. Tree cover ($\backslash$textgreater8. m) in central Auckland was 6\% of the land area, 63.2\% of which was on private land. Of these trees, approximately 15\% were protected. The tree species protected reflected cultural heritage; popular species were protected in large numbers, whilst only a single individual of a threatened native species was protected. The highest numbers of listed trees were in older suburbs, those with higher density housing, and those with lower levels of socio-economic deprivation. A low correlation between vegetation cover and listed-tree density shows that the proportion of trees protected varies substantially in different areas. We conclude that this case-by-case tree protection strategy provides insufficient protection for Auckland's urban biodiversity, but better implementation would improve biodiversity and social outcomes.},

Colombian cacao has been classified as a fine flavor cacao that represents the 5\% of cacao world's production. Colombian genetic resources from this species are conserved in ex situ and in-field germplasm banks, since T. cacao has recalcitrant seeds to desication and long-term storage. Currently, the collection of T. cacao of the Colombian Corporation of Agricultural Research (CORPOICA) has approximately 700 germplasm accessions. We conducted a molecular analysis of Corpoica's cacao collection and a morphological characterization of some accessions with the goal to study its genetic diversity and population structure and, to select interesting accessions for the cacao's breeding program. Phenotypic evaluation was performed based on 18 morphological traits and 4 biochemical traits. PCA analysis of morphological traits explained 60.6\% of the total variation in seven components and 100\% of the total variation of biochemical traits in four components, grouping the collection in 4 clusters for both variables. We explored 565 accessions from Corpoica's germplasm and 252 accessions from reference populations using 96 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) molecular markers. Molecular patterns of cacao Corpoica's collection were obtained amplifying specific alleles in a Fluidigm platform that used integrated circuits of fluids. Corpoica's collection showed highest genetic diversity [Expected Heterozygosity (HE = 0.314), Observed Heterozygosity (HO = 0.353)] that is reduced when reference populations were included in the dataset (HE = 0.294, HO =0.261). The collection was divided into four clusters based on population structure analysis. Cacao accessions from distinct groups showed some taxonomic concordance and reflected their geographic origins. For instance, accessions classified as Criollo were clearly differentiated in one group and we identified two new Colombian genetic groups. Using a number of allelic variations based on 87 SNP markers and 22 different morphological/biochemical traits, a core collection with a total of 232 accessions was selected as a primary genetic resource for cacao breeders.},

In California, however, projections of changes in annual precipitation are inconsistent. Analysis of daily precipitation in 30 GCMs reveals patterns in projected hydrometeorology over each of the five MedClm regions globally and helps disentangle their causes. MedClim regions, except California, are expected to dry via decreased frequency of winter precipitation. Frequencies of extreme precipitation, however, are projected to increase over the two MedClim regions of the Northern Hemisphere where projected warming is strongest. The increase in heavy and extreme precipitation is particularly robust over California, where it is only partially offset by projected decreases in low-medium intensity precipitation. Over the Mediterranean Basin, however, losses from decreasing frequency of low-medium-intensity precipitation are projected to dominate gains from intensifying projected extreme precipitation. MedClim regions are projected to become more sub-tropical, i.e. made dryer via pole-ward expanding subtropical subsidence. California's more nuanced hydrological future reflects a precarious balance between the expanding subtropical high from the south and the south-eastward extending Aleutian low from the north-west. These dynamical mechanisms and thermodynamic moistening of the warming atmosphere result in increased horizontal water vapor transport, bolstering extreme precipitation events.},

Finally, we discuss methodological issues and priorities for future research.

For this purpose, a sample of 557 rooms in Halkidiki, Greece was collected through an online database during the summer tourist season. Subsequently, these data were integrated into a GIS-system in order to apply a spatial hedonic model. A semi-parametric geographically weighted regression model was used to assess the local effects, as well as, to investigate the spatial variability of the selected attributes. The results exhibited a significant spatial variability concerning the effect of sea view to room rates, indicating that local natural and/or tourism resources may have a substantial role in aesthetic values.},

This paper presents findings from a qualitative study with tree managers and other relevant officers from local municipal authorities in South-East Queensland, Australia that examined factors influencing street tree selection and planting. Participants outlined three predominant motives for planting street trees: environmental (100\%), visual and aesthetic (92\%), and statutory (92\%). In contrast, participants identified species characteristics (100\%), site factors (100\%), costs (92\%), and management and maintenance issues (83\%) as the most important governing factors for street tree species selection. Only half of the officers noted ecosystem services (50\%), along with visual and aesthetic benefits (50\%) as species selection factors. Economic, health, socio-cultural and community benefits were not mentioned among the species-selection criteria. The interviews with municipal officers revealed that the parameters governing street tree species selection in South-East Queensland do not conform to the environmental and aesthetic reasons that were cited as the primary motivations for planting street trees. Local research focused on the benefits and problems of Australian street tree species may empower councils to revise their street tree policies and integrate ecosystem services and disservices as part of the process of selecting appropriate species.},

  abstract = {We review and synthesize information on invasions of nonnative forest insects and diseases in the United States, including their ecological and economic impacts, pathways of arrival, distribution within the United States, and policy options for reducing future invasions. Nonnative insects have accumulated in United States forests at a rate of $\sim$2.5 per yr over the last 150 yr. Currently the two major pathways of introduction are importation of live plants and wood packing material such as pallets and crates. Introduced insects and diseases occur in forests and cities throughout the United States, and the problem is particularly severe in the Northeast and Upper Midwest. Nonnative forest pests are the only disturbance agent that has effectively eliminated entire tree species or genera from United States forests within decades. The resulting shift in forest structure and species composition alters ecosystem functions such as productivity, nutrient cycling, and wildlife habitat. In urban and suburban areas, loss of trees from streets, yards, and parks affects aesthetics, property values, shading, stormwater runoff, and human health. The economic damage from nonnative pests is not yet fully known, but is likely in the billions of dollars per year, with the majority of this economic burden borne by municipalities and residential property owners. Current policies for preventing introductions are having positive effects but are insufficient to reduce the influx of pests in the face of burgeoning global trade. Options are available to strengthen the defenses against pest arrival and establishment, including measures taken in the exporting country prior to shipment, measures to ensure clean shipments of plants and wood products, inspections at ports of entry, and post-entry measures such as quarantines, surveillance, and eradication programs. Improved data collection procedures for inspections, greater data accessibility, and better reporting would support better evaluation of policy effectiveness. Lack of additional action places the nation, local municipalities, and property owners at high risk of further damaging and costly invasions. Adopting stronger policies to reduce establishments of new forest insects and diseases would shift the major costs of control to the source and alleviate the economic burden now borne by homeowners and municipalities.},

Property managers may have private incentives to control invasive species despite not having sufficient incentive to fully internalize the external costs of their role in spreading the invasion. Each property manager has a right to future use of his own property, but his property may abut others' properties enabling spread of an invasive species. The incentives for a foresighted property manager to control invasive species have received little attention. We consider the efforts of a foresighted property manager who has rights to future use of a property and has the ability to engage in repeated, discrete control activities. We find that higher rates of dispersal, associated with proximity to neighboring properties, reduce the private incentives for control. Controlling species at one location provides incentives to control at a neighboring location. Control at neighboring locations are strategic complements and coupled with spatial heterogeneity lead to a weaker-link public good problem, in which each property owner is unable to fully appropriate the benefits of his own control activity. Future-use rights and private costs suggest that there is scope for a series of Coase-like exchanges to internalize much of the costs associated with species invasion. Pigouvian taxes on invasive species potentially have qualitatively perverse behavioral effects. A tax with a strong income effect (e.g, failure of effective revenue recycling) can reduce the value of property assets and diminish the incentive to manage insects on one's own property.},

  abstract = {The establishment of interdisciplinary Master's and PhD programs in sustainability science is opening up an exciting arena filled with opportunities for early-career scholars to address pressing sustainability challenges. However, embarking upon an interdisciplinary endeavor as an early-career scholar poses a unique set of challenges: to develop an individual scientific identity and a strong and specific methodological skill-set, while at the same time gaining the ability to understand and communicate between different epistemologies. Here, we explore the challenges and opportunities that emerge from a new kind of inter-disciplinary journey, which we describe as 'undisci-plinary.' Undisciplinary describes (1) the space or condition of early-career researchers with early interdisci-plinary backgrounds, (2) the process of the journey, and (3) the orientation which aids scholars to address the complex nature of today's sustainability challenges. The undisci-plinary journey is an iterative and reflexive process of balancing methodological groundedness and epistemolog-ical agility to engage in rigorous sustainability science. The paper draws upon insights from a collective journey of broad discussion, reflection, and learning, including a sur-vey on educational backgrounds of different generations of sustainability scholars, participatory forum theater, and a panel discussion at the Resilience 2014 conference (Montpellier, France). Based on the results from this diversity of methods, we suggest that there is now a new and distinct generation of sustainability scholars that start their careers with interdisciplinary training, as opposed to only engaging in interdisciplinary research once strong disciplinary foundations have been built. We further identify methodological groundedness and epistemological agility as guiding competencies to become capable sus-tainability scientists and discuss the implications of an undisciplinary journey in the current institutional context of universities and research centers. In this paper, we propose a simple framework to help early-career sustain-ability scholars and well-established scientists successfully navigate what can sometimes be an uncomfortable space in education and research, with the ultimate aim of producing and engaging in rigorous and impactful sustainability science.},

  abstract = {This study compiled recent inventory data from 929,823 street trees in 50 cities to determine trends in tree number and density, identify priority investments and create baseline data against which the efficacy of future practices can be evaluated. The number of street trees increased from 5.9 million in 1988 to 9.1 million in 2014, about one for every four residents. Street tree density declined from 65.6 to 46.6 trees per km, nearly a 30\% drop. City streets are at 36.3\% of full stocking. State-wide, only London planetree (Platanus \texttimes{} hispanica) comprises over 10\% of the total, suggesting good state-wide species diversity. However, at the city scale, 39 communities were overly reliant on a single species. The state's street trees remove 567,748 t CO2 (92,253 t se) annually, equivalent to taking 120,000 cars off the road. Their asset value is \$2.49 billion (\$75.1 million se). The annual value (USD) of all ecosystem services is \$1.0 billion (\$58.3 million se), or \$110.63 per tree (\$29.17 per capita). Given an average annual per tree management cost of \$19.00, \$5.82 in benefit is returned for every \$1 spent. Management implications could include establishing an aggressive program to plant the 16 million vacant sites and replace removed trees, while restricting planting of overabundant species. Given the tree population's youth there is likely need to invest in pruning young trees for structure and form, which can reduce subsequent costs for treating defects in mature trees.},

Spread is facilitated primarily by human transportation, but there is increasing concern that climate change allows establishment in hitherto unsuitable regions. However, interactions between climate change, crops and pests are complex, and the extent to which crop pests and pathogens have altered their latitudinal ranges in response to global warming is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate an average poleward shift of 2.7$\pm$0.8 km yr-1 since 1960, in observations of hundreds of pests and pathogens, but with significant variation in trends among taxonomic groups. Observational bias, where developed countries at high latitudes detect pests earlier than developing countries at low latitudes, would result in an apparent shift towards the Equator.

Its establishment in Europe and the Americas resulted in local disease transmission and impacted quality of outdoor recreational activities. Economic implications of its likely invasion into Australia had not been considered. A benefit-cost analysis of an elimination response scenario to an Ae. albopictus incursion in Brisbane was devel-oped with a benefits transfer estimate of the local population's willingness-to-pay for an Ae. albopictus-free envi-ronment. Other costed considerations included i) necessary precautionary vector control responses to importations of mosquito-borne diseases (e.g. dengue, Zika) and ii) projected rises in complaints to local govern-ment regarding increased mosquito nuisance. Costs of implementing a successful elimination program were estimated between 1 and 4 AU\$ per capita, and the annual benefit-cost ratio regarding the value of an unaffected outdoor environment was between 50 and 78. In the event of establishment, annual costs of local government and public health responses were between 0.5 and 1.3 AU\$ per capita. The recurrent expense of permanent colonization will be magnified by loss of value asso-ciated with an Ae. albopictus-free environment.

  abstract = {Climate change affects the rate of insect invasions as well as the abundance, distribution and impacts of such invasions on a global scale. Among the principal analytical approaches to predicting and understanding future impacts of biological invasions are Species Distribution Models (SDMs), typically in the form of correlative Ecological Niche Models (ENMs). An underlying assumption of ENMs is that species\textendash{}environment relationships remain preserved during extrapolations in space and time, although this is widely criticised. The semi-mechanistic modelling platform, CLIMEX, employs a top-down approach using species ecophysiological traits and is able to avoid some of the issues of extrapolation, making it highly applicable to investigating biological invasions in the context of climate change. The tephritid fruit flies (Diptera: Tephritidae) comprise some of the most successful invasive species and serious economic pests around the world. Here we project 12 tephritid species CLIMEX models into future climate scenarios to examine overall patterns of climate suitability and forecast potential distributional changes for this group. We further compare the aggregate response of the group against species-specific responses. We then consider additional drivers of biological invasions to examine how invasion potential is influenced by climate, fruit production and trade indices. Considering the group of tephritid species examined here, climate change is predicted to decrease global climate suitability and to shift the cumulative distribution poleward. However, when examining species-level patterns, the predominant directionality of range shifts for 11 of the 12 species is eastward. Most notably, management will need to consider regional changes in fruit fly species invasion potential where high fruit production, trade indices and predicted distributions of these flies overlap.},

  abstract = {The recent expansion of Aedes albopictus, a day-biting mosquito, to densely inhabited areas in the northeastern Atlantic states of the USA has dramatically increased the problem that mosquitoes create for urban and suburban residents. We quantified the impact of mosquitoes on residents' quality of life within the context of a comprehensive area-wide integrated pest management program to control Ae. albopictus in two counties (Mercer and Monmouth) in New Jersey. We interviewed residents of 121 randomly selected households in both counties between October and November 2010. We asked residents about their experience with mosquitoes in their neighborhood and the importance of the ability to relax outdoors without mosquitoes compared to other neighborhood characteristics (1 = not important, 5 = extremely important). We rated residents' utility based on paired comparisons to known states from the EuroQol health description system. The majority (54.6\{\%\}) of respondents considered mosquitoes to be a problem. Respondents reported an average of 7.1 mosquito bites in a typical week during that summer. Mosquitoes prevented 59.5\{\%\} of residents from enjoying their outdoor activities at least to some extent. Residents rated the mosquito acceptability (mean $\pm$ standard deviation) during that summer on a scale of 0 (mosquito invasion) to 100 (no mosquitoes) at 56.7$\pm$28.7, and their overall utility at 0.87$\pm$0.03. This is comparable to living with up to two risk factors for diabetes (i.e., abdominal obesity, body mass index of 28 or more, reported cholesterol problems, diagnosis of hypertension, or history of cardiovascular disease) or women experiencing menstrual disorders. Respondents rated the importance of enjoying outdoor activities without mosquitoes (4.69$\pm$0.80) comparable to that of neighborhood safety (4.74$\pm$0.80) and higher than that of a clean neighborhood (4.59$\pm$0.94). In conclusion, New Jersey residents reported that mosquitoes decreased their utility by 0.13, comparable to the loss from worrisome health risk factors, underscoring the importance of controlling this problem.},

  abstract = {Our ability to predict the identity of future invasive alien species is largely based upon knowledge of prior invasion history. Emerging alien species-those never encountered as aliens before-therefore pose a significant challenge to biosecurity interventions worldwide. Understanding their temporal trends, origins, and the drivers of their spread is pivotal to improving prevention and risk assessment tools. Here, we use a database of 45,984 first records of 16,019 established alien species to investigate the temporal dynamics of occurrences of emerging alien species worldwide. Even after many centuries of invasions the rate of emergence of new alien species is still high: One-quarter of first records during 2000-2005 were of species that had not been previously recorded anywhere as alien, though with large variation across taxa. Model results show that the high proportion of emerging alien species cannot be solely explained by increases in well-known drivers such as the amount of imported commodities from historically important source regions. Instead, these dynamics reflect the incorporation of new regions into the pool of potential alien species, likely as a consequence of expanding trade networks and environmental change. This process compensates for the depletion of the historically important source species pool through successive invasions. We estimate that 1-16\% of all species on Earth, depending on the taxonomic group, qualify as potential alien species. These results suggest that there remains a high proportion of emerging alien species we have yet to encounter, with future impacts that are difficult to predict.},

  abstract = {The urban heat island is a particular challenge for tropical cities, which receive year-round high inputs of solar radiation. Plants can help mitigate elevated urban temperatures by providing shade and increasing evaporative cooling, although the resulting increase in humidity may negatively affect thermal comfort. Street trees offer particular potential for cooling urban microclimates, as well as providing other ecosystem services, because they can be integrated within dense urban street networks. However, we have little quantitative information about the role of street trees in providing regulating ecosystem services in tropical cities. In this study, we analysed hemispherical photographs extracted from Google Street View to quantify the proportion of green canopy coverage at 50 m intervals across more than 80\% of Singapore's road network. Canopy coverage data were then used to estimate the proportion of annual radiation that would be blocked from reaching ground level by the canopy. Across all locations, a median of 13\% of the annual diffuse and direct solar radiation was shaded, and over 70\% of this shading effect was due to the tree canopy. There was significant variation between different urban landuse types, with trees providing more shade in parks and low-density low-rise areas than in industrial and higher-density residential areas. Mapping the provision of street tree ecosystem services could help to prioritise areas for new planting by identifying streets or street sections with low shading. The approach developed in this article could be readily applied to quantify the proportion of canopy coverage and proportion of solar radiation shaded across other tropical cities. The method may also be applicable in temperate cities if Google Street View photographs were collected during the growing season.},

We compiled the most comprehensive database of economic costs of invasive insects, expressing historical estimates in annual 2014-equivalent US dollars. Taking all reported goods and services estimates, invasive insects cost a minimum of US\$70.0 billion year-1 globally, while global health costs directly attributable to invasive insects exceed US\$6.9 billion year-1. Total costs rise as the number of estimates increases, although many of the worst costs have already been estimated (especially those related to human health). A lack of dedicated studies, especially for reproducible goods and services estimates, implies gross underestimation of global costs. Global warming as a consequence of climate change, rising human population densities and intensifying international trade will allow the costliest insects to spread into new areas, although substantial savings could be achieved by increasing surveillance, containment and public awareness.},

  abstract = {Many fungal plant diseases are strongly controlled by weather, and global climate change is thus likely to have affected fungal pathogen distributions and impacts. Modelling the response of plant diseases to climate change is hampered by the difficulty of estimating pathogen-relevant microclimatic variables from standard meteorological data. The availability of increasingly sophisticated high-resolution climate reanalyses may help overcome this challenge. We illustrate the use of climate reanalyses by testing the hypothesis that climate change increased the likelihood of the 2008\textendash{}2011 outbreak of Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR, Hemileia vastatrix) in Colombia. We develop a model of germination and infection risk, and drive this model using estimates of leaf wetness duration and canopy temperature from the Japanese 55-Year Reanalysis (JRA-55). We model germination and infection as Weibull functions with different temperature optima, based upon existing experimental data. We find no evidence for an overall trend in disease risk in coffee-growing regions of Colombia from 1990 to 2015, therefore, we reject the climate change hypothesis. There was a significant elevation in predicted CLR infection risk from 2008 to 2011 compared with other years. JRA-55 data suggest a decrease in canopy surface water after 2008, which may have helped terminate the outbreak. The spatial resolution and accuracy of climate reanalyses are continually improving, increasing their utility for biological modelling. Confronting disease models with data requires not only accurate climate data, but also disease observations at high spatio-temporal resolution. Investment in monitoring, storage and accessibility of plant disease observation data are needed to match the quality of the climate data now available.This article is part of the themed issue `Tackling emerging fungal threats to animal health, food security and ecosystem resilience'.},

In efforts to help resolve associated problems we have developed a framework for integrated assessments of ecosystem service (ES) benefits and values provided by urban greenery, based on the ecosystem service cascade model. The aim is to provide a method for assessing the contribution to, and valuing, multiple ES provided by urban greenery that can be readily applied in routine planning processes. The framework is unique as it recognizes that an urban greenery comprises several components and functions that can contribute to multiple ecosystem services in one or more ways via different functional traits (e.g. foliage characteristics) for which readily measured indicators have been identified. The framework consists of five steps including compilation of an inventory of indicator; application of effectivity factors to rate indicators' effectiveness; estimation of effects; estimation of benefits for each ES; estimation of the total ES value of the ecosystem. The framework was applied to assess ecosystem services provided by trees, shrubs, herbs, birds, and bees, in green areas spanning an urban gradient in Gothenburg, Sweden. Estimates of perceived values of ecosystem services were obtained from interviews with the public and workshop activities with civil servants. The framework is systematic and transparent at all stages and appears to have potential utility in the existing spatial planning processes.},

All the neighbourhood shops in urban and a majority in rural areas stocked personal protection products. As many as 99.3 and 73\% of the urban and rural respondents, respectively, were found to use personal-protection measures during some or all seasons of the year. Mosquito coils were the most widely used measure in both urban and rural areas, followed by vaporising mats in the former and electric fans in the latter areas. 48 and 40\% in urban and rural areas, respectively, used personal-protection measures daily. In urban areas 46\% used the measures in more than one room. Only a small proportion (3-14\%) used bed nets. The average monthly expenditure on the measures was Rupees (Rs.) 62.17 (US\$ 1.30) (range: Rs. 0.00-500.00) in urban areas and Rs. 8.03 (US\$ 0.17) (range Rs. 0.00-45.00) in rural areas. Annual expenditure on personal protection measures in urban areas amounted to 0.63\% of the per capita income. 73.7\% of the respondents in urban areas expressed satisfaction with the protective effect of the measures used by them. However, 46.3\% of the urban and 15\% of the rural respondents felt that the personal-protection measures are harmful to health.

The widespread application of these tools has brought with it an emerging understanding that patterns in biogeog- raphy, introduction history and subsequent movement and spread of many invasive alien insects are far more complex than previously thought. We reviewed the literature and found that for a number of invasive insects, there is strong and growing evidence that multiple introductions, complex global movement, and population admixture in the invaded range are commonplace. Additionally, historical paradigms related to species and strain identities and origins of common invaders are in many cases being challenged. This has major consequences for our understanding of basic biology and ecology of invasive insects and impacts quarantine, management and biocontrol pro- grams. In addition, we found that founder effects rarely limit fitness in invasive insects and may benefit populations (by purging harmful alleles or increasing additive genetic variance). Also, while phenotypic plasticity appears important post-establishment, genetic diversity in invasive insects is often higher than expected and increases over time via multiple introductions. Further, connectivity among disjunct regions of global invasive ranges is generally far higher than expected and is often asymmetric, with some populations contributing disproportionately to global spread.Weargue that the role of connectivity in driving the ecology and evolution of introduced species with multiple invasive ranges has been histor- ically underestimated and that such species are often best understood in a global context.},

  abstract = {Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), a phloem-feeding beetle native to Asia, was discovered near Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario in 2002. As of March 2009, isolated populations of emerald ash borer (EAB) have been detected in nine additional states and Quebec. EAB is a highly invasive forest pest that has the potential to spread and kill native ash trees (Fraxinus sp.) throughout the United States. We estimate the discounted cost of ash treatment, removal, and replacement on developed land within communities in a 25-state study area centered on Detroit using simulations of EAB spread and infestation over the next decade (2009\textendash{}2019). An estimated 38 million ash trees occur on this land base. The simulations predict an expanding EAB infestation that will likely encompass most of the 25 states and warrant treatment, removal, and replacement of more than 17million ash trees with mean discounted cost of \$10.7 billion. Expanding the land base to include developed land outside, as well as inside, communities nearly double the estimates of the number of ash trees treated or removed and replaced, and the associated cost. The estimates of discounted cost suggest that a substantial investment might be efficiently spent to slow the expansion of isolated EAB infestations and postpone the ultimate costs of ash treatment, removal, and replacement.},

  abstract = {Rigorous assessments of the economic impacts of introduced species at broad spatial scales are required to provide credible information to policy makers. We propose that economic models of aggregate damages induced by biological invasions need to link microeconomic analyses of site-specific economic damages with spatial-dynamic models of value change associated with invasion spread across the macro-scale landscape. Recognizing that economic impacts of biological invasions occur where biological processes intersect the economic landscape, we define the area of economic damage (AED) as the sum of all areas on the physical landscape that sustain economic damage from a biological invasion. By subsuming fine-scale spatial dynamics in the AED measure, temporal dynamics of the AED can be estimated from an empirical distribution of the AED effective range radius over time. This methodology is illustrated using the case of a non-native forest pest, the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae). Geographic Information Systems and spatially referenced data provide the basis for statistical estimation of a spatial-dynamic value transfer model which indicates that HWA is annually causing millions of dollars of economic losses for residential property owners in the eastern United States. \textcopyright{} 2010.},

We used ecological niche modeling (ENM) approaches to explore its likely geographic poten- tial. Two techniques, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) and a maximum entropy approach (MaxEnt), were used. However, MaxEnt provided more significant results, with all 5 random replicate subsamples having P $\backslash$textless 0.002 while GARP models failed to achieve statistical significance in 3 of 5 cases, in which predictions achieved probabilities of 0.07 $\backslash$textless P $\backslash$textless 0.10. The MaxEnt models predicted successfully the known distribution, includ- ing the single North American occurrence point of Laguna Beach, California, and various areas where the pest has been reported in North Africa, southern Europe, Middle East and South and Southeastern Asia. In addition, areas where the pest has not been yet reported were found to be suitable for invasion by RPW in sub-Saharan Africa, southern, central and northern America, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Highly suitable areas in the United States of America were limited mostly to coastal California and southern Florida, while all Carib- bean islands were found highly suitable for establishment and spread of the pest.},

In this study, the impact of symptomatic dengue virus infection on the families of patients hospitalized at the Kamphaeng Phet Provincial Hospital with laboratory-confirmed dengue in 2001 was assessed, and the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost for fatal and non-fatal cases of dengue were calculated using population level data for Thailand. When we accounted for the direct cost of hospitalization, indirect costs due to loss of productivity, and the average number of persons infected per family, we observed a financial loss of approximately US\$61 per family, which is more than the average monthly income in Thailand. The DALYs were calculated using select results from a family level survey, and resulted in an estimated 427 DALYs/million population in 2001. This figure is of the same order of magnitude as the impact of several diseases currently given priority in southeast Asia, such as the tropical cluster (trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis, and onchocerciasis), malaria, meningitis, and hepatitis. These results indicate that dengue prevention, control, and research should be considered equally important as that of diseases currently given priority.},

  abstract = {A budget proposal to stop the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding in surveillance and research for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and West Nile virus has the potential to leave the country ill-prepared to handle new emerging diseases and manage existing ones. In order to demonstrate the consequences of such a measure, if implemented, we evaluated the impact of delayed control responses to dengue epidemics (a likely scenario emerging from the proposed CDC budget cut) in an economically developed urban environment. We used a mathematical model to generate hypothetical scenarios of delayed response to a dengue introduction (a consequence of halted mosquito surveillance) in the City of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. We then coupled the results of such a model with mosquito surveillance and case management costs to estimate the cumulative costs of each response scenario. Our study shows that halting mosquito surveillance can increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude in comparison to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. Our analysis shows that the total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the ones needed to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens, even without consideration of the cost in human lives and well-being. More specifically, our findings provide a science-based justification for the re-assessment of the current proposal to slash the budget of the CDC vector-borne diseases program, and emphasize the need for improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance.},

We then coupled these relationships with published trade forecasts to predict future invasion rates for insects, plant pathogens, and mollusks. Relationships between the accumulation of non-native species and merchandise imports were reasonably described by log-log and log-linear species-area models and Michaelis-Menten accumulation functions. However, the latter two models produced markedly better fits. When coupled with projected trade forecasts, the log-linear species-area model predicted 16\textendash{}24\% taxon-specific increases in the number of nonindigenous species established in the United States from 2000 to 2020.

  title = {Quantifying the Impact of Chikungunya and Dengue on Tourism Revenues},
  abstract = {Background Health economists have traditionally quantified the burden of vector-borne diseases (such as chikungunya and dengue) as the sum of the cost of illness and the cost of intervention programmes. The objective of this paper is to predict the order of magnitude of possible reduction in tourism revenues if a major epidemic of chikungunya or dengue were to discourage visits by international tourists, and to prove that even a conservative estimate can be comparable to or even greater than the cost of illness and intervention programmes combined, and therefore should not be ignored in the estimation of the overall burden. Methods We have chosen three Asian economies where the immediate costs of these diseases have been recently calculated: Gujarat (an economically important state of India), Malaysia, and Thailand. Only international tourists from non-endemic countries have been considered to be discouraged, and a 4\% annual decline in their numbers has been assumed. Revenues from these tourists have been calculated assuming that tourists from non-endemic countries would spend, on average, the same amount as all international tourists. These assumptions are conservative and consistent with the recent experience of Mauritius and R\'eunion islands. Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) have been considered half as likely to avoid travel to Gujarat compared to non-Indians. This paper reports inflation-adjusted expenditure figures as 2008 US\$, assuming recent market exchange rates of 42.0 INR/US\$, 3.22 MYR/US\$, 0.68 EUR/US\$, and 33.6 THB/US\$. Findings A 4\% decline in tourists from non-endemic countries would result in a substantial loss of tourism revenues . at least US\$ 8 million for Gujarat, US\$ 65 million for Malaysia, and US\$ 363 million for Thailand. The estimated immediate annual cost of chikungunya and dengue to these economies is US\$ 90 million, US\$ 133 million, and approximately US\$ 127 million respectively, indicating that impact on tourism revenues should not be ignored when calculating the burden of infectious diseases. The impact on Gujarat is relatively less because its share of world tourism receipts is just 0.04\%, whereas Malaysia and Thailand have healthy shares of 1.64\% and 1.82\% respectively. A 4\% decline in tourists to Gujarat from other Indian states would amount to US\$ 9.6 million loss in domestic tourism revenues to Gujarat. Interpretation This paper shows that potential loss of tourism revenues due to a severe epidemic outbreak could be substantial. In some cases, ignoring this component could seriously underestimate cost-benefit results, forestalling promising interventions that could benefit the society as a whole or leading to inadequate investment of resources in prevention and public-funded control programmes. This would be to the detriment of especially poorer sections of the society, who may not be able to afford treatment costs. At present data are insufficient for us to make more than a preliminary estimate of the magnitude of the potential loss of revenues from tourism due to a major outbreak of chikungunya or dengue.},

En su forma adulta es un escarabajo de color marr\'on-rojizo de unos 35 mm de longitud. Presenta manchas negras en el prot\'orax que le dan un aspecto caracter\'istico. Las hembras tienen el " pico " largo y delgado, mientras que en los machos es m\'as ancho, corto, menos curvado y se caracteriza por un peine de pelos cortos a lo largo del pico. Son activos durante el d\'ia, los adultos se desplazan de una palmera a otra caminando o volando, pudiendo recorrer distancias de varios kil\'ometros. El resto de estadios permanece en el interior de la palmera, pueden convivir simult\'aneamente diferentes formas en el mismo ejemplar hospedante. La hembra deposita los huevos de forma individual, bajo la corteza de la palmera, en un agujero que ellas mismas hacen con el " rostrum " o en los cortes y heridas de poda. Cada hembra ovoposita entre 300-400 huevos por ciclo. Despu\'es de la eclosi\'on las larvas comienzan a alimentarse del tejido vegetal interno de la palmera, creando galer\'ias que pueden llegar a tener hasta un metro de longitud y produciendo los principales da\~nos. El desarrollo larval dura de 1 a 3 meses en funci\'on de la temperatura, alcanzando la larva unos 5 cm de longitud al final. Finalizado el desarrollo larval, construye un capullo con fibras del interior de las palmeras para pupar. Esta fase dura de 15 a 30 d\'ias. Una vez finalizada la metamorfosis el adulto permanece en el interior unos 10 d\'ias m\'as.},

The present study used CLIMEX 1.1 to predict the potential distribution of R. ferrugineus in China according to both current climate data (1981-2010) and future climate warming estimates based on simulated climate data for the 2020s (2011-2040) provided by the Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research (TYN SC 2.0). Additionally, the Ecoclimatic Index (EI) values calculated for different climatic conditions (current and future, as simulated by the B2 scenario) were compared. Areas with a suitable climate for R. ferrugineus distribution were located primarily in central China according to the current climate data, with the northern boundary of the distribution reaching to 40.1$^\circ$N and including Tibet, north Sichuan, central Shaanxi, south Shanxi, and east Hebei. There was little difference in the potential distribution predicted by the four emission scenarios according to future climate warming estimates. The primary prediction under future climate warming models was that, compared with the current climate model, the number of highly favorable habitats would increase significantly and expand into northern China, whereas the number of both favorable and marginally favorable habitats would decrease. Contrast analysis of EI values suggested that climate change and the density of site distribution were the main effectors of the changes in EI values. These results will help to improve control measures, prevent the spread of this pest, and revise the targeted quarantine areas.},

By 1998, average losses due to thrips feeding damage in untreated infested groves reduced industry revenues by 12\%. Producer costs increased by about 4.5\% when S. perseae populations required management. In the short run (i.e., the time period during which the industry adapts to managing a new pest), producers cannot fully adapt to increases in production costs and the annual cost of S. perseae to producers with a thrips infestation is estimated to be \$8.65 million (US). In the long run (i.e., the time period after which the industry has fully adapted to the effects of a new pest), producers are able to fully reallocate resources to their most efficient use and the annual cost of S. perseae is calculated to be \$5.22 million (US) per year. For the entire USA avocado industry, the annual short-run loss attributable to S. perseae in California is calculated to be \$8.51 million (US) and \$4.45 million (US) in the long run. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Spatially distributed chlorophyll content of urban vegetation provides an important indicator of a plant's health status, which might depend on the habitat quality of the specific urban environment. Recent advances in optical remote sensing led to improved methodologies to monitor vegetation properties. The hyperspectral index NAOC (Normalized Area Over reflectance Curve) is one of these new tools that can be used for mapping chlorophyll content. In this paper we present the work done to quantify vegetation chlorophyll content over the city of Valencia (Spain) based on chlorophyll measurements of four representative tree species: the London plane tree (Platanus x. acerifolia), the Canarian date palm (Phoenix canariensis), the European nettle tree (Celtis australis) and the white mulberry (Morus alba). Measurements were acquired during the summer of 2011, in a field campaign in which for 320 leaf samples, chlorophyll content was measured both in the laboratory and by using a SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter. Both methods were correlated (R2 $\backslash$textgreater 0.86), using best fit power type functions. During the field campaign an aircraft with a CASI (Compact Airborne Spectral Imager) hyperspectral sensor onboard overflew the city obtaining imagery with a spatial resolution of $\sim$1 m suitable to identify individual urban trees. From the CASI data the NAOC index was calculated and linked with the laboratory chlorophyll content measurements. This led to a detailed chlorophyll content map with a RMSE of 15 $\mu$g cm -2. Chlorophyll map analysis at the individual crown level suggests the applicability to identify trees with lowered chlorophyll content due to a suboptimal habitat quality. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Insects are among the world's most ecologically and economically important invasive species. Here we assemble inventories of native and non-native species from 20 world regions and contrast relative numbers among these species assemblages. Multivariate ordination indicates that the distribution of species among insect orders is completely different between native and non-native assemblages. Some orders, such as the Psocoptera, Dictyoptera, Siphonaptera, Thysanoptera, and Hemiptera, are always over-represented in the non-native compared to native assemblages. Other orders, such as the Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Mecoptera and Microcoryphila, are consistently under-represented in non-native assemblages. These patterns most likely arise both as a result of variation among taxa in their association with invasion pathways responsible for transporting species among world regions, as well as variation in life-history traits that affect establishment potential. However, our results indicate that species compositions associated with invasiveness are fundamentally different from compositions related to insularity, indicating that colonization of islands selects for a different group of insect taxa than does selection for successful invaders. Native and non-native assemblage compositions were also related, to a lesser extent, to latitude of the region sampled. Together, these results illustrate the dominant role of invasion pathways in shaping the composition of non-native insect assemblages. They also emphasize the difference between natural background colonization of islands and anthropogenic colonization events, and imply that biological invasions are not a simple subset of a long-standing ecological process.},

  abstract = {Limitations in the assessment of cultural ecosystem services through quantifiable approaches have constrained our knowledge of how these services can be altered by drivers of global change, such as non-native tree species. Here, we address this caveat by evaluating the effects of non-native tree species, in comparison to native ones, on several categories of cultural services, i.e., recreation and ecotourism, aesthetics, inspiration, and cultural heritage. We propose an indicator-based approach that includes the use of a meta-analysis statistics, the odds ratio, to evaluate photographic, internet and catalogue data, and to infer on the effects of non-native trees on cultural services. We apply our approach to the Iberian Peninsula, exploring potential environmental and socio-economic predictors of non-native tree effects across NUTS-2 administrative regions. Overall, non-native tree effects differed among categories of cultural services and varied with the data type. Non-native trees increased recreation and ecotourism services, when considering data from official tourism entities, but not from nature route users. Data from inventories of urban parks and catalogues of ornamental plant dealers suggested that non-native trees decreased aesthetics services, particularly in Spain, but not in Portugal. Non-native trees also increased cultural heritage services, but no significant effects were observed on inspiration services. Overall, non-native trees showed higher increases in cultural services across regions with lower levels of development (in terms of income, employment and education) and life satisfaction. We suggest that management should emphasise awareness on non-native trees, including the risks involved in promoting the expansion of potentially invasive species. Efforts to raise awareness should prioritise official tourism entities and ornamental plant dealers, with a special focus on less developed regions. Our proposed approach represents a pioneer assessment of the relations between non-native trees and cultural ecosystem services, supporting strategic management in Iberia. The focus on widely available data sources enables reproducibility and application in assessments worldwide.},

We investigate tree nursery offerings in Los Angeles County over the past 110 years through the use of here-to-fore unexplored nursery catalogs to determine the diversity of trees that have been commercially available over time. Tree species information was collected spanning a 110-year study period and analyzed the data for four time periods (1900-1929, 1930-1959, 1960-1989, and 1990-2011). We found the number of genera and tree species offered significantly increased in the past 20 years (1990-2011). The numbers of non-native trees, angiosperms, and deciduous species all significantly increased with but no changes were observed in the numbers of native, evergreen, or gymnosperm species offered over this time period. The largest numbers of palm species were offered in 1900-1929. Overall there were 562 unique species offered belonging to 201 different genera in the 120-year study period, 48 species were California native trees and 514 of these were non-native species indicating that perhaps Los Angeles has one of the most diverse number of tree species offered for sale by the nursery industry. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

This is the first report for this species in Wester n Europe. Separate surveys were conducted to assess the geographical distribution, host plant susceptibility and natural enemies of T. peregrinus . To ascertain the geographical distribution of T. peregrinus surveys were conducted between May and June 2012 at 53 sites in central and southern Portugal. T. peregrinus was present in only three sites, which were all located in Lisbon and surrounding areas suggesting an introduction pathway through the harbors or the airport in this coastal city. Of the 30 Eucalyptus species present in Lisbon's Eucalyptus arboretum, 14 were confirmed as infested by T. peregrinus during the first survey in April 2012. In August 2012 the host range had increased to 19 Eucalyptus species, revealing an expansion phase. We report the first record of Hemerobius bolivari Banks (Neuroptera Hemerobiidae), a native of South America, preying on T. peregrinus nymphs. This is the first record of H. bolivari in Europe and we hypothesized that this predator may have reached Europe together with its prey.},

  abstract = {Average Customer Rating: 5.0 Rating: 4 Overall good, but could be less technical I was really excited when I ordered this book as it looked like the type of material I had been looking for for ages, but as it turns out I am mildly disappointed in it, primarily because I found the text somewhat hard to grasp and the code not particularly well explained. It is still a very good read though and certainly helped me enhance my knowledge of statistical analyses in R. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to examine spatial data in R, but there is a bit of homework to do to be able to understand how all the pieces fit together. Rating: 5 Just what is needed This book fills a gap in the Spatial Statistics literature. Most of the treatises are heavy on the math, and I find it difficult to bridge the gap between the formulas and applying them. The modules for R take care of this for you and leave you to interpret the result. This book covers most of these modules and demonstrates how to use them. Really worth getting. There is also the ESRI Guide to GIS Analysis Vol 2, but it is more of an introductory text. Rating: 5 Excelent Book! Do you know that felling you may have when you found exactly what you were looking for? Well, that was the felling I had when started to read this book. It brings detailed information about how you can and should use the spatial data analysis resources of R, with interactive examples and enlighten explanations. You will really understand what you are doing and will find ways to represent it the best way you could. Rating: 5 Lots of information, clearly presented. This is not a book for a beginner, but is an excellent book for two groups of readers: those who have some background with R and wish to learn about its capabilities for spatial statistics; and those with some background in spatial statistics who wish to learn how to use R. The authors have been the main developers of the spatial statistics packages on R, and therefore know the packages intimately. But the authors also have a deep knowledge of the spatial statistics literature, and I found myself learning something new about these methods in every chapter. Everyone serious about spatial statistics should see what R has to offer. This book is the easiest way to do that. Rating: 5 The best practial introduction to R spatial The R spatial packages are the leading edge for spatial analysis and spatial statistics. This book, by the primary developers of the R Spatial packages, is the best introduction to the subject that I have seen. Now, if you are comfortable with it, you can dive an and download R and R spatial and go to town. But if you need some help, this is a good place to start. This would also make a good textbook for a class on spatial analysis.},

  abstract = {Globally, many invasive alien species have caused extensive ecological and economic damage from either accidental or intentional introduction. The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, has created billions of dollars in costs annually, spreading as an invasive species across the southern United States. In 1998, the red imported fire ant spread into California creating a highly probable future introduction via shipped products to Hawaii. This paper presents the estimation of potential economic impacts of the red imported fire ant (RIFA) to the state of Hawaii. Evaluation of impacts focuses on the economic sectors of (1) households, (2) agriculture (cattle and crop production), (3) infrastructure (cemeteries, churches, cities, electrical, telephone, and cable services, highways, hospitals and schools), (4) recreation, tourism and business (hotels/resort areas, golf courses, commercial businesses and tourists), and (5) government expenditures (with minimal intervention). The full annual economic costs of the red imported fire ant to Hawaii are estimated (in US\$ 2006) to be \$211 million/year, comprised of \$77 million in damages and expenditures and \$134 million in foregone outdoor opportunities to households and tourists. The present value of the projected costs of RIFA over a 20-year period after introduction total \$2.5 billion. RIFA invasions across the globe indicate that economic cost-effective action in Hawaii entails implementation of prevention, early detection and rapid response treatment programs for RIFA. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {This study used tree data from field plots in urban areas to describe forest structure in urban areas throughout California. The plot data were used with numerical models to calculate several ecosystem services produced by trees. A series of transfer functions were calculated to scale-up results from the plots to the landscape using urban tree canopy (UTC) mapped at 1-m resolution for each combination of 6 land use classes and climate zones. California's UTC covered 15\% of the urban area and contained 173.2 million trees, five per city resident. UTC per capita was lowest among U.S. states (90.8 m2), indicating ample opportunity for tree planting. Oaks were the most abundant taxon (22\%) and overall plantings were youthful. The annual value of ecosystem services was estimated at \$8.3 billion and the urban forests asset value was \$181 billion. Assuming an average annual per tree management cost of \$19 and benefit of \$47.83, \$2.52 in benefit was returned for every dollar spent. The threat posed by Invasive Shot Hole Borer (Euwallacea sp.) illustrates that urban forests are a relatively fragile resource whose contributions to human health and well-being can be suddenly jeopardized. One scenario projected that should Southern California cities lose 50\% (11.6 million) of all susceptible trees, the value of ecoservices foregone over 10 years was \$616.6 million. The approximate cost of removing and replacing the trees was \$15.9 billion. Strategies to reduce the risk of catastrophic loss by increasing the resilience of California's urban forests are discussed.},

The need to avoid economic losses because of insect pest populations is one of the greatest challenges faced by this sector. Insect pests have caused annual losses of US\$12.0 billion to the Brazilian economy, of which approximately US\$1.6 billion are because of exotic pest species. Furthermore, exotic insect species often show greater potential to cause harm than native species. In Brazil, since the late nineteenth century, 24 species of insect pests have been introduced into the country, and they have caused significant economic losses. Many of these species, including Bemisia tabaci, Hypothenemus hampei, Ceratitis capitata, Oryzophagus oryzae and Anthonomus grandis, are major crop pests, and they were accidentally introduced during trading of agricultural products. In this review, we present an overview of Brazilian agriculture, a brief history of the introduction of insect pests in the country and the Brazilian legislation on agricultural defence, and we estimate the economic losses caused to the Brazilian economy by the main insect pest species that have been introduced into Brazil over the last 112 years.},

  abstract = {Urbanisation and a changing climate are leading to more frequent and severe flood, heat and air pollution episodes in Britain's cities. Interest in nature-based solutions to these urban problems is growing, with urban forests potentially able to provide a range of regulating ecosystem services such as stormwater attenuation, heat amelioration and air purification. The extent to which these benefits are realized is largely dependent on urban forest management objectives, the availability of funding, and the understanding of ecosystem service concepts within local governments, the primary delivery agents of urban forests. This study aims to establish the extent to which British local authorities actively manage their urban forests for regulating ecosystem services, and identify which resources local authorities most need in order to enhance provision of ecosystem services by Britain's urban forests. Interviews were carried out with staff responsible for tree management decisions in fifteen major local authorities from across Britain, selected on the basis of their urban nature and high population density. Local authorities have a reactive approach to urban forest management, driven by human health and safety concerns and complaints about tree disservices. There is relatively little focus on ensuring provision of regulating ecosystem services, despite awareness by tree officers of the key role that urban forests can play in alleviating chronic air pollution, flood risk and urban heat anomalies. However, this is expected to become a greater focus in future provided that existing constraints \textendash{} lack of understanding of ecosystem services amongst key stakeholders, limited political support, funding constraints \textendash{} can be overcome. Our findings suggest that the adoption of a proactive urban forest strategy, underpinned by quantified and valued urban forest-based ecosystem services provision data, and innovative private sector funding mechanisms, can facilitate a change to a proactive, ecosystem services approach to urban forest management.},

However, remote sensing introduces unfamiliar perspectives since it changes the scale and resolution perceived by humans. Real estate prices also fluctuate and are not regularly used in urban decision-making processes. This study values an urban forest cultural ecosystem service by integrating an explanatory hedonic regression model with randomly field-measured tree, shrub, and turf data from four cities across Florida, USA, during 2006-2009, and congruent parcel tract-level home attributes and appraised property values from single and multi-family units for 2008-2009. Results, on average, indicate trade-offs in that more trees with greater Leaf Area Indices (LAIs) add to property value, while biomass and tree-shrub cover have a neutral effect, and replacing tree with grass cover has lower value. On average, property value increased by \$1586 per tree and \$9348 per one-unit increase in LAI, while increasing maintained grass from 25\% to 75\% decreased home value by \$271. Our ecological approach is an alternative, applied method that can be used by decision-makers for policy and cost-benefit analyses that calculate the stream of net benefits associated with urban forests.},

Some categories of invasive species-such as diseases of humans and live-stockare addressed by international agreements that coordinate efforts to reduce their spread. In contrast, invasive species that primarily cause environmental impacts are managed almost exclusively at the national level. Control of environmental invaders is internationally undersupplied because the efforts of nations that do invest to prevent their spread are undercut by nations that do not. Addressing this problem will require international cooperation. We identify the international approach to controlling human diseases as a model that could provide institutions and mechanisms to map the spread of environmental invaders and assess the risks they impose. This would allow individual nations to manage potential vectors of invasion. Because such a system is unlikely to be implemented in the near future, we make recommendations for intermediate steps, including the widespread adoption of existing risk assessments and importation standards. 2011 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

Consequently, the benefits arising from preventive policies should be clearly articulated and included in the evaluation process. The present study evaluates the potential benefits of alternative prevention measures in the metropolitan area of Athens, Greece, representative of the geographically and climatically vulnerable Mediterranean cities. The study differentiates the health and nuisance costs associated with invasive mosquito species from those associated with native mosquito species. In contrast to other findings in the literature, the benefits from controlling health impacts were found to be higher than those of avoiding nuisance. This is mainly related to the high health risk induced by new invasive species. Another important finding is that the expected benefits of mosquito control programs clearly outweigh the respective costs.},

  abstract = {Executive Summary We conducted this economic analysis at the request of USDA-APHIS-PPQ-EDP. Our objective was to quantitatively characterize the economic costs to apple, grape, orange and pear crops that would result from the introduction of the light brown apple moth (LBAM), Epiphyas postvittana, into the conterminous United States. This information can be used to inform regulatory policy and funding decisions regarding LBAM. Our economic analysis had two components: 1) a geospatial analysis that identified areas at risk for LBAM establishment based on climate and hosts and 2) a quantitative analysis, using a probabilistic modeling approach, which estimated the economic losses LBAM could cause if introduced into these areas due to damage, control, quarantines and research. Economic effects outside of the agricultural crop (apple, grape, orange and pear) production sector, e.g. trade effects, are beyond the scope of this analysis and are not provided. Our geospatial analysis estimated that LBAM could establish throughout the majority of the conterminous United States. This establishment range included the majority of the growing area for the analyzed crops.},

Previous work typically assumes invasive species risk to be exogenous and commonly known. Here, we examine cases in which endogenous actions (exporter abatement) affect risk and allow for unobservable differences in exporter abatement cost. We show how the optimal inspection/penalty regime differs in such cases from that derived for homogeneous exporters. The information asymmetry also makes it optimal for the regulator to provide technical assistance grants even if it would be otherwise inefficient to do so. Further, we show that the fungibility of technical assistance with inputs in other sectors of the exporting economy significantly affects the qualitative nature of the optimal policy. If it has no outside value in the exporter's country, the optimal policy is characterized by a menu of contracts trading off higher tariffs with lower penalties for being caught with an invasive. If technical assistance can be used in other sectors of the exporter's economy, it introduces countervailing incentives that make it optimal for the regulator to use a uniform tariff/penalty combination for all exporters.},

The diagnosis of date palm sector highlights the strengths, constrains, weaknesses, and opportunities of the sector. With the exception of some modern palm farms, the agricultural practices are generally traditional in oases. The Green Morocco Plan (PMV) designed and monitored by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAPM) designated this crop as a priority to give new impetus to the agricultural economy in oasis areas. Researchers investigated date palm protection especially to control bayoud disease, cultivar characterization, tissue culture micropropagation, and date valorization. Main development actions include distribution of over 1.5 million of vitro-plants since 1987 to farmers in order to restructure and reconstitute palm groves, encouraging investments and facilitating of new planting, encouraging research on water dynamics and participatory actions of water users, installation of refrigerated storage and some date processing, promoting domestic marketing and exports and ensuring of national coordination and networking of actors of date palm sector in the context of a Geographic Information System (GIS). The cvs. described were chosen for their level of representation. A promising future is expected for Moroccan date palm oases if all the actors reinforce the economic challenge and awareness of preservation of the environmental ecosystem.},

Only scarce and incomplete natural history studies were known from its native distribution area. Studying the biology of this species in its invasive distribution range was thus a prerequisite to the implementation of efficient control methods in a near future. During a 3-year field survey, we collected 77 nests to investigate several of the species' key colony characteristics. Our results enabled us to accurately quantify each of the castes and to better understand their synchronicity throughout the season. Our study showed that mature nests are able to produce up to 13 000 individuals and that the size of mature nests is correlated to the number of individuals produced. This correlation enables the inference of one characteristic from the other. Furthermore, each mature nest can produce up to several hundreds of potential founder queens, a crucial datum in the light of today's unregulated spring queen trapping control campaigns. In addition, nest dissections enabled to record the incidence of nest relocation for the first time in this species. Results are discussed with regards to what is known in other Vespidae species, with a focus on Vespula species that are known to be invasive in many other countries worldwide.},

We demonstrate the approach by allocating surveys outside the quarantine area established following the discovery of the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Ontario, Canada. We use historical data on ALB spread to generate a set of invasion scenarios that characterizes the uncertainty of the pest's extent in the GTA. We then use these scenarios to find allocations of surveys and tree removals aimed at managing the spread of the pest in the GTA. It is optimal to spend approximately one-fifth of the budget on surveys and the rest on tree removal. Optimal solutions do not always select sites with the greatest propagule pressure, but in some cases focus on sites with moderate likelihoods of ALB arrival and low host densities. Our approach is generalizable and helps support decisions regarding control of invasive species when knowledge about a species' spread is uncertain.},

  abstract = {Biological invasions by nonnative species are a by-product of economic activities, with the vast majority of nonnative species introduced by trade and transport of products and people. Although most introduced species are relatively innocuous, a few species ultimately cause irreversible economic and ecological impacts, such as the chestnut blight that functionally eradicated the American chestnut across eastern North America. Assessments of the economic costs and losses induced by nonnative forest pests are required for policy development and need to adequately account for all of the economic impacts induced by rare, highly damaging pests. To date, countrywide economic evaluations of forest-invasive species have proceeded by multiplying a unit value (price) by a physical quantity (volume of forest products damaged) to arrive at aggregate estimates of economic impacts. This approach is inadequate for policy development because (1) it ignores the dynamic impacts of biological invasions on the evolution of prices, quantities, and market behavior, and (2) it fails to account for the loss in the economic value of nonmarket ecosystem services, such as landscape aesthetics, outdoor recreation, and the knowledge that healthy forest ecosystems exist. A review of the literature leads one to anticipate that the greatest economic impacts of invasive species in forests are due to the loss of nonmarket values. We proposed that new methods for evaluating aggregate economic damages from forest-invasive species need to be developed that quantify market and nonmarket impacts at microscales that are then extended using spatially explicit models to provide aggregate estimates of impacts. Finally, policies that shift the burden of economic impacts from taxpayers and forest landowners onto parties responsible for introducing or spreading invasives, whether through the imposition of tariffs on products suspected of imposing unacceptable risks on native forest ecosystems or by requiring standards on the processing of trade products before they cross international boundaries, may be most effective at reducing their impacts.},

This study evaluated species composition, floristic diversity, amenity-ecological characteristics, habitat condition, and performance of trees in domestic gardens in urban Hong Kong. The 1501 individual trees belonged to 72 species, 61 genera and 36 families, with domination by a small cohort of popular species. Tree composition skewed heavily toward exotic species count (81.9\%) and tree count (91.1\%). The most prominent amenity-ecological attributes were fast growth and establishment and interesting tree form and foliage, accounting respectively for 38, 32 and 27 species. Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) indicated strong association between species distribution in domestic gardens and habitat-tree variables, such as tree density, tree aggregation, species aggregation, lots with trees and house lots. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) showed positive correlation (p$\backslash$textless. 0.05) between tree and species counts and lot frontage and garden depth. Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) identified 16 species with relatively widespread presence in moderate or severe structural damage groups; and 22 species with very poor or poor overall condition. RDA further demonstrated positive correlation (p$\backslash$textless. 0.05) between structural damage and overall condition, and tree position and confinement type. The contribution of domestic gardens in the urban greening program could be improved with appropriate incentives, and be integrated into a comprehensive landscape plan. The management implications with reference to preservation and enhancement of garden trees could be applied to south China and other cities. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Much evidence is accumulating that insect distributions are changing. The changing earth's climate is providing mobile species with an evolving ``hospitability'' template, and increasing global commerce expands opportunities for mobile species to colonize new habitats. Predicting the distribution of insects in the face of accelerating global commerce and climate change is quite a challenge. Many fruitful approaches are available and are being improved. Some are correlative; some are based on process-level knowledge. We have focused on an eco-physiological approach based on the known responses of species to specific weather factors at the physiological level. Of particular importance are developmental responses, of course, as they determine climates under which an insect can achieve a stable, adaptive seasonality. With this underlying minimal requirement, models can also take into account other weather influences such as cold tolerance and the deleterious effects of too much heat. In this paper, we illustrated the use of this approach to predict the change of distribution and potential impacts of the spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.), a major native insect pest of conifer forests in North America. Like previous work on the invasive gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) and the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins), the present work points to the following conclusions concerning the effects of global warming on species distributions: (1) they will shift towards the poles (and to higher elevations); (2) temperate regions will bear the brunt of these shifts; and (3) distribution shifts may be good or bad, depending on the species and the regions concerned.},

Many prioritization schemes quantify impact and risk, from the pragmatic and action-focused to the data-demanding and science-based. Effective prioritization must consider not only invasive species and pathways (as mentioned in Aichi Target 9), but also which sites are most sensitive and susceptible to invasion (not made explicit in Aichi Target 9). Integrated prioritization across these foci may lead to future efficiencies in resource allocation for invasion management. Many countries face the challenge of prioritizing with little capacity and poor baseline data. We recommend a consultative, science-based process for prioritizing impacts based on species, pathways and sites, and outline the information needed by countries to achieve this. This should be integrated into a national process that incorporates a broad suite of social and economic criteria. Such a process is likely to be feasible for most countries.},

Relationships between the accumulation of non-native species and merchandise imports were reasonably described by log-log and log-linear species-area models and Michaelis-Menten accumulation functions. However, the latter two models produced markedly better fits. When coupled with projected trade forecasts, the log-linear species-area model predicted 16\textendash{}24\% taxon-specific increases in the number of nonindigenous species established in the United States from 2000 to 2020. The Michaelis-Menten model predicted much lower 3\textendash{}6\% increases, but even this meant 115 new insect species and 5 new plant pathogens.

We apply a spatial hedonic model to estimate the value of urban trees in 23 suburbs of Perth Metropolitan Area in Western Australia. Results show that a broad-leaved tree on the street verge increases the median property price by about AU\$16,889, suggesting a positive neighbourhood externality of broad-leaved trees. However, neither broad-leaved trees on the property or on neighbouring properties nor palm trees irrespective of the locations contributed significantly to sale price. Our result has potential implications on planting and maintaining broad-leaved trees on street verges for neighbourhood development and urban planning to generate public and private benefits of street trees. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Some categories of invasive species-such as diseases of humans and live-stockare addressed by international agreements that coordinate efforts to reduce their spread. In contrast, invasive species that primarily cause environmental impacts are managed almost exclusively at the national level. Control of environmental invaders is internationally undersupplied because the efforts of nations that do invest to prevent their spread are undercut by nations that do not. Addressing this problem will require international cooperation. We identify the international approach to controlling human diseases as a model that could provide institutions and mechanisms to map the spread of environmental invaders and assess the risks they impose. This would allow individual nations to manage potential vectors of invasion. Because such a system is unlikely to be implemented in the near future, we make recommendations for intermediate steps, including the widespread adoption of existing risk assessments and importation standards. 2011 by American Institute of Biological Sciences.

The results suggest that the UK public have an extremely strong preference to avoid a status quo scenario where pollinator populations and pollination services decline. Total willingness to pay was high and did not significantly vary between the two pollination service outputs, producing a conservative total of ??379M over a sample of the tax-paying population of the UK, equivalent to ??13.4 per UK taxpayer. Using a basic production function approach, the marginal value of pollination services to these attributes is also extrapolated.

  abstract = {Since 1993, the annual worldwide cost of diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), control has been routinely quoted to be US\$1 billion. This estimate requires updating and incorporation of yield losses to reflect current total costs of the pest to the world economy.We present an analysis that estimates what the present costs are likely to be based on a set of necessary, but reasoned, assumptions. We use an existing climate driven model for diamondback moth distribution and abundance, the Food and Agriculture Organization country Brassica crop production data and various management scenarios to bracket the cost estimates. The ``length of the string'' is somewhere between US\$1.3 billion and US\$2.3 billion based on management costs. However, if residual pest damage is included then the cost estimates will be even higher; a conservative estimate of 5\% diamondback moth induced yield loss to all crops adds another US\$2.7 billion to the total costs associated with the pest. A conservative estimate of total costs associated with diamondback moth management is thus US\$4 billion - US\$5 billion. The lower bound represents rational decision making by pest managers based on diamondback moth abundance driven by climate only. The upper estimate is due to the more normal practice of weekly insecticide application to vegetable crops and the assumption that canola (Brassica napus L.) is treated with insecticide at least once during the crop cycle. Readers can decide for themselves what the real cost is likely to be becauseweprovide country data for further interpretation. Our analysis suggests that greater efforts at implementation of even basic integrated pest management would reduce insecticide inputs considerably, reducing negative environmental impacts and saving many hundreds of millions of dollars annually.},

In this study we evaluated the potential effects of tree shade on residential air conditioning and heating energy use for a range of tree orientations, building insulation levels and climate zones in California using computer simulation. Trees shading a home's west exposure produced the largest savings, both annual (kWh) and peak (kW), for all climate zones and insulation levels considered. Next largest savings were for southwest (annual and peak) and east (annual only) locations. Three trees (two on the west, one on the east side) reduced annual energy use for cooling 10 to 50 percent (200 to 600 kWh, \$30 to \$110) and peak electrical use up to 23 percent (0.7 kW). Except in climates with little air-conditioning demand, cooling load reductions were always greater than increased heating loads associated with shade from south side trees in winter. Air-conditioning savings, both peak and annual, were larger in warmer climates and uninsulated buildings; percentage savings were larger in cooler climates and for more energy efficient buildings. Recommen- dations are made regarding locating yard trees to maximize energy savings.},

New technologies increase the pace at which humans and commodities can move around the world. Recent research on IAS at the global scale has examined commerce and travel in order to inform predictions, risk analyses, and policy. Due to limited data, regional-scale studies have primarily focused on invasion patterns rather than impacts. Local-scale experimental research can identify mechanisms and impacts of biological invasions, but the results may not be applicable at larger spatial scales. However, the number of information networks devoted to IAS is increasing globally and may help integrate IAS research at all scales, particularly if data sharing and compatibility can be improved. Integrating ecological and economic factors with trade analysis to explore the effectiveness of different approaches for preventing invasions is a promising approach at the global scale.

  abstract = {Objective: To assess the burden of dengue disease in Colombia and its associated costs. Methods: We estimated the burden of dengue and severe dengue in Colombia for the period 2011 to 2014 on the basis of a dynamic model calibrated against Colombian surveillance data. The model estimated the annual number of dengue and severe dengue cases for those receiving medical care and those who do not. We calculated the average cost of care per patient on the basis of a bottom-up costing of cases, and additional costs were estimated for activities of vector control and other community interventions. Economic information from a sample of local and departmental vector control programs was reviewed. Results: The dynamic model estimated that for 2011 and 2012 there would be 56,998 dengue cases requiring medical attention (22,799 ambulatory and 34,199 hospitalized), 1851 cases of severe dengue, and 205 deaths. The economic analysis, with 2011 data, showed that Colombia would spend between US \$52.2 and US \$61.0 million for dengue control activities and case management in an average year. Medical management costs would amount to US \$16.9 million (CI 95\% 15.2-18.5 million), while vector control activities and other community interventions would cost between US \$37.08 and US \$42.41 million. Conclusions: Dengue infection has an important impact on the health care system budget in Colombia. Most of the economic impact corresponds to community activities directed to prevent vector infestation (68.7\%-71.0\%), which are expensive and whose effectiveness is controversial. \textcopyright{} 2012 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).},

Few studies have incorporated social dimensions of invasive alien species (IAS) management. In this study, we surveyed visitors (N=1166) to Cumberland Island National Seashore, GA, USA, to measure their knowledge of, attitudes toward, and preferences for various IAS management options. Multinomial logistic regression, two-step cluster analysis, and the Potential for Conflict Index were used to determine factors that predict support for IAS control, identify subgroups of visitors with unique management preferences, and evaluate the level of consensus among these distinct groups. Results showed that, although knowledge and perceived threat scores were related to management preferences, environmental attitude orientations were the best indicators of support for IAS control. Absolute ecocentric visitors (typically younger, less educated individuals with less experience in parks) believed that all living things have a right to coexist without disruption and favored a hands-off management approach. Adaptive ecocentric visitors (typically older, more educated individuals with more experience in parks) believed that some degree of human interference is necessary to maintain ecosystem integrity and favored hands-on management. Despite these different perspectives, adaptive on-site control of invasive species was viewed as the most acceptable and least controversial management option across all visitor subgroups. This study may inform IAS management practices by providing a framework for identifying stakeholder characteristics and synthesizing public preferences to minimize conflict and highlight ecologically beneficial and socially acceptable outcomes. \textcopyright{} 2011.},

Looking at potential spatial aggregation of invasive species, we identify three future hotspots of invasion in Europe, northeastern North America, and Oceania. We also emphasize that some regions could lose a significant number of invasive alien species, creating opportunities for ecosystem restoration. From the list of 100, scenarios of potential range distributions show a consistent shrinking for invasive amphibians and birds, while for aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates distributions are projected to substantially increase in most cases.

  abstract = {Biological invasions are a worldwide phenomenon, but the global flows between native and alien regions have rarely been investigated in a cross-taxonomic study. We therefore lack a thorough understanding of the global patterns of alien species spread. Using native and alien ranges of 1380 alien species, we show that the number of alien species follows a hump-shaped function of geographic distance. We observe distinct variations in the relationship between alien species exchanges and distance among taxonomic groups, which relate to the taxa-specific dispersal modes and their pathways of introduction. We formulate a simple statistical model, combining trade volume and biogeographic dissimilarity, which reproduces the observed pattern in good agreement with reported data and even captures variations among taxonomic groups. This study demonstrates the universality of the intermediate distance hypothesis of alien species spread across taxonomic groups, which will help to improve the predictability of new alien species arrivals.

  abstract = {Despite expanding interest in ecosystem service research over the past three decades, in-depth understanding of the contribution of forests and trees to food production and livelihoods remains limited. This review synthesizes the current evidence base examining the contribution of forest and trees to agricultural production and livelihoods in the tropics, where production often occurs within complex land use mosaics that are increasingly subjected to concomitant climatic and anthropogenic pressures. Using systematic review methodology we found 74 studies investigating the effect of forest or tree-based ecosystem service provision on a range of outcomes such as crop yield, biomass, soil fertility, and income. Our findings suggest that when incorporating forests and trees within an appropriate and contextualized natural resource management strategy, there is potential to maintain, and in some cases, enhance yields comparable to solely monoculture systems. Furthermore, this review has illustrated the potential of achieving net livelihood gains through integrating trees on farms, providing rural farmers with additional income sources, and greater resilience strategies to adapt to market or climatic shocks. However, we also identify significant gaps in the current knowledge that demonstrate a need for larger-scale, longer term research to better understand the contribution of forest and trees within the broader landscape and their associated impacts on livelihoods and food production systems.},

The developmental time of R. ferrugineus was 68.8 days on Washington palm (Washingtonia filifera), 74.1 days on Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis), 82.1 days on Chusan palm (Trachycarpus fortunei), 85.4 days on pindo palm (Butia capitata) and 90.6 days on silver date palm (Phoenix sylvestris), respectively, and the developmental time on silver date palm was significantly longer than that on the other plants. The survival of immature R. ferrugineus ranged from 25.0 to 38.3\%. Most mature larvae began to pupate at eighth-instar on Canary Island date palm and Washington palm, while on Chusan palm, Pindo palm and silver date palm, most of them began to pupate at ninth-instar. The mean lifetime fecundity of R. ferrugineus on Canary Island date palm, Chusan palm, Pindo palm, Washington palm and silver date palm was 267.8, 134.0, 109.8, 216.0, and 131.4 eggs, respectively, and lifetime fecundity on Canary Island date palm and Washington palm was significantly greater than that on the other plants. The intrinsic rate of natural increase (r(m)), net reproductive rate (R-0) and mean generation time (T) were 0.038, 78.3 and 115.0 days on Canary Island date palm, 0.028, 33.1 and 125.5 days on Chusan palm, 0.029, 40.9 and 128.2 days on Pindo palm, 0.041, 64.0, 101.4 days on Washington palm, and 0.025, 30.6, 135.6 days on silver date palm, respectively. Based on population growth parameters, it is concluded that Canary Island date palm and Washington palm were the more suitable host plants and silver date palm was the least suitable host plant for R. ferrugineus.},

This study was conducted to assess household-level expenditure on protective measures against mosquito nuisance on the Island of La R\'eunion in 2012.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data was collected during a cross-sectional survey of 1024 households and used to determine the relationship between the use of chemically-based protective measures and subjective and objective indicators of the density of Aedes albopictus. The average household expenditure in July 2012 was USD 9.86 and the total household-level expenditure over a one-year period was extrapolated to USD 28.05million (range: USD 25.58 million to USD 30.76 million). Much of this money was spent on measures thought to be relatively ineffective against Aedes mosquitoes. Expenditure on protective measures was not influenced by the level of knowledge on mosquitoes or by the visual nuisance they generated at home, but rather by the perception of risk related to a future epidemic of chikungunya and socioeconomic factors. Most importantly, household spending on protective measures was found to be influenced by a measure of zone-level mosquito density (the Breteau index), but not by objective indicators of the presence of mosquitoes within or around the house.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Household-level expenditure on chemically-based protective measures is high when compared to the investment made by public entities to achieve vector control, and it is differentially influenced by subjective and objective measures of mosquito density. The current situation could be improved, firstly by ensuring that the public is well-informed about mosquitoes and the effectiveness of various protective measures, and secondly by implementing interventions that could either complement current vector-control strategies and improve their effectiveness on a country-level, or that would steer the population toward the appropriate behaviours.},

Volumetric Hirst type spore traps recorded pollen levels continuously for three years. Ornamental street trees in the study area were identified, counted and mapped. Airborne pollen records were found to be related to the number of trees, the proximity of the trees to traps, the different pollination systems and wind direction. A total of 17635 trees, from all localities were counted, belonging to 67 species, 58\% anemophilous, 22\% entomophilous, and 20\% both pollination systems. Five species represented more than 50\% of the total number of ornamental trees: Platanus hispanica, Olea europaea, Ulmus minor, Acer negundo and Melia azedarach. The average total pollen concentration in g m-3 was 102 (DB), 93 (PL), and 99 (ZA)$\backslash$ldots Omitting the data for Quercus pollen, a statistically significant correlation between the number of trees at 0.5 km around the spore traps and the types of pollen recorded was found. Some measures to decrease the amount of potential allergenic airborne pollen in urban environments were identified, such as reducing trees with anemophilic pollination systems, eliminating male trees and employing suitable pruning practices. In any case, the closer the source of ornamental pollen, the greater the allergenic risks.},

The microclimatic temperature conditions where the insects live were recorded monthly (August?February). The insect lives in a microhabitat with temperatures much lower compared to the outer sunny atmosphere during summer. During winter, the minimum microclimatic temperature during daytime was 12$^\circ$C compared with 16.1$^\circ$C in the outer atmosphere. Records in the microclimate of infected trees were always higher compared to those of healthy ones, with a difference of 1?2$^\circ$C. A high significant difference was observed with respect to infestation levels among different cultivars of date palm. The biology and life history of the weevil have been investigated on five diets, namely banana, sugarcane, squash fruit, apple and palm crown. The weevil was maintained on these diets, but the rate of development showed great variation. The duration of generation was the shortest on palm crown, followed by banana and then squash fruit and apple, but it was longer on sugarcane. Egg production was the highest on palm crown being 338 $\pm$ 37.24 eggs/female followed by banana, squash fruit, and apple, but the lowest production (117. $\pm$ 18.9 eggs/female) was obtained on sugarcane. The fertility ranged between 52 and 83\% in those eggs deposited by females previously reared on different diets.},

Here we report on the development of a database designed for the collation of information in Britain. The project involved working with volunteer experts to populate a database of NNS (hereafter called ``the species register''). Each species occupies a row within the database with information on aspects of the species' biology such as environment (marine, freshwater, terrestrial etc.), functional type (predator, parasite etc.), habitats occupied in the invaded range (using EUNIS classification), invasion pathways, establishment status in Britain and impacts. The information is delivered through the Great Britain Non-Native Species Information Portal hosted by the Non-Native Species Secretariat. By the end of 2011 there were 1958 established NNS in Britain. There has been a dramatic increase over time in the rate of NNS arriving in Britain and those becoming established. The majority of established NNS are higher plants (1,376 species). Insects are the next most numerous group (344 species) followed by non-insect invertebrates (158 species), vertebrates (50 species), algae (24 species) and lower plants (6 species). Inventories of NNS are seen as an essential tool in the management of biological invasions. The use of such lists is diverse and far-reaching. However, the increasing number of new arrivals highlights both the dynamic nature of invasions and the importance of updating NNS inventories.},

We use hedonic property price modeling to estimate urban tree cover's value in Dakota and Ramsey Counties, MN, USA, predicting housing value as a function of structural, neighborhood, and environmental variables, including tree cover, using a spatial simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) error model. We measure tree cover as percent tree cover on parcels, and within 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 m. Results show that tree cover within 100 and 250 m is positive and statistically significant. A 10\% increase in tree cover within 100 m increases average home sale price by \$1371 (0.48\%) and within 250 m increases sale price by \$836 (0.29\%). In a model including both linear and squared tree cover terms, tree cover within 100 and 250 m increases sale price to 40-60\% tree cover. Beyond this point increased tree cover contributes to lower price. Tree cover beyond 250 m did not contribute significantly to sale price. These results suggest significant positive effects for neighborhood tree cover, for instance, for the shading and aesthetic quality of tree-lined streets, indicating that tree cover provides positive neighborhood externalities.},

  abstract = {Species moved by human activities beyond the limits of their native geographic ranges into areas in which they do not naturally occur (termed aliens) can cause a broad range of significant changes to recipient ecosystems; however, their impacts vary greatly across species and the ecosystems into which they are introduced. There is therefore a critical need for a standardised method to evaluate, compare, and eventually predict the magnitudes of these different impacts. Here, we propose a straightforward system for classifying alien species according to the magnitude of their environmental impacts, based on the mechanisms of impact used to code species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Global Invasive Species Database, which are presented here for the first time. The classification system uses five semi-quantitative scenarios describing impacts under each mechanism to assign species to different levels of impact-ranging from Minimal to Massive-with assignment corresponding to the highest level of deleterious impact associated with any of the mechanisms. The scheme also includes categories for species that are Not Evaluated, have No Alien Population, or are Data Deficient, and a method for assigning uncertainty to all the classifications. We show how this classification system is applicable at different levels of ecological complexity and different spatial and temporal scales, and embraces existing impact metrics. In fact, the scheme is analogous to the already widely adopted and accepted Red List approach to categorising extinction risk, and so could conceivably be readily integrated with existing practices and policies in many regions.},

Results show that the cumulative total impacts could be as high as \$5.4 million from B. rubostriata only or \$71.6 million from B. rubostriata and the phytoplasma after 5 years.

We use recent innovations in accounting standard setting to classify 2,665 shareholder proposals that address environmental and social issues as financially material or immaterial, and we analyze how proposals on material versus immaterial issues are related to firms' subsequent environmental or social performance and market valuation. We find that 58 percent of the shareholder proposals in our sample are filed on immaterial issues. We document that filing shareholder proposals are related to subsequent improvements in the performance of the company on the focal environmental or social issue, even though such proposals nearly never received majority support. Improvements occur across both material and immaterial issues. Proposals on immaterial issues are associated with subsequent declines in firm valuation while proposals on material issues are associated with subsequent increases in firm value. We show that companies increase performance on immaterial issues because of agency problems, low awareness of the materiality of sustainability issues, and attempts to divert attention from poor performance on material issues.},

The contingent valuation method was used to obtain a willingness to pay (WTP) estimate for a policy to protect important biodiversity from IAS. Tourists indicated a mean WTP of US\$52-US\$58 on top of their usual expenditures to fund conservation policy. At present approximately US\$0.25. million per year is spent on IAS control while the economic damage associated with 4 key IAS is approximately US\$21. million per year. Comparing the benefits from eradication with the costs involved gives a benefit-cost ratio greater than unity, indicating that the policy of eradicating IAS is economically justified. However, there is a long way to go before the resources devoted to the problem will be in proportion to the risks. ?? 2010.},

  abstract = {We surveyed the life history of the red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae), in southern Japan, including seasonal changes in the flight activity of adults and composition of R. ferrugineus in different developmental stages in a total of 17 infested Phoenix canariensis trees which were cut down in 2003\textendash{}2005. The flight of adults began in Mar, showed some peaks in summer and autumn, and ceased in mid-Dec. Various stages of individuals inhabited infested P. canariensis trees throughout the year. The composition of individuals at different stages in late fall was dependent on the resource (white intact tissue) availability in P. canariensis trees. In P. canariensis trees where considerable resource remained, all stages of larvae, pupae, and adults were found, whereas in palm trees with no resource, few young- and medium-stage larvae were observed. The temperature in the infested part of a palm trunk was 30$^\circ$C or higher even in winter. From these results, we view the life history of R. ferrugineus in southern Japan as follows: Adults emerge from host trees in spring and continue to attack host trees until late fall. Rhynchophorus ferrugineus grows even in winter if intact tissue remains at the peripheral part of trunks, and there may be 3 or 4 generations per year. A cold winter probably does not have any negative effects on successful colonization of R. ferrugineus in Japan.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To document how out-of-pocket health expenditure can lead to debt in a poor rural area in Cambodia. METHODS: After a dengue epidemic, 72 households with a dengue patient were interviewed to document health-seeking behaviour, out-of-pocket expenditure, and how they financed such expenditure. One year later, a follow-up visit investigated how the 26 households with an initial debt had coped with it. RESULTS: The amount of out-of-pocket health expenditure depended mostly on where households sought care. Those who had used exclusively private providers paid on average US dollars 103; those who combined private and public providers paid US dollars 32, and those who used only the public hospital US dollars 8. The households used a combination of savings, selling consumables, selling assets and borrowing money to finance this expenditure. One year later, most families with initial debts had been unable to settle these debts, and continued to pay high interest rates (range between 2.5 and 15\% per month). Several households had to sell their land. CONCLUSIONS: In Cambodia, even relatively modest out-of-pocket health expenditure frequently causes indebtedness and can lead to poverty. A credible and accessible public health system is needed to prevent catastrophic health expenditure, and to allow for other strategies, such as safety nets for the poor, to be fully effective.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.pce.2016.05.003},
  abstract = {This work presents a methodology to make statistical significant and robust inferences on climate change from an ensemble of model simulations. This methodology is used to assess climate change projections of the Iberian daily-total precipitation for a near-future (2021???2050) and a distant-future (2069???2098) climates, relatively to a reference past climate (1961???1990). Climate changes of precipitation spatial patterns are estimated for annual and seasonal values of: (i) total amount of precipitation (PRCTOT), (ii) maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD), (iii) maximum of total amount of 5-consecutive wet days (Rx5day), and (iv) percentage of total precipitation occurred in days with precipitation above the 95th percentile of the reference climate (R95T). Daily-total data were obtained from the multi-model ensemble of fifteen Regional Climate Model simulations provided by the European project ENSEMBLES. These regional models were driven by boundary conditions imposed by Global Climate Models that ran under the 20C3M conditions from 1961 to 2000, and under the A1B scenario, from 2001 to 2100, defined by the Special Report on Emission Scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Non-parametric statistical methods are used for significant climate change detection: linear trends for the entire period (1961???2098) estimated by the Theil-Sen method with a statistical significance given by the Mann-Kendall test, and climate-median differences between the two future climates and the past climate with a statistical significance given by the Mann-Whitney test. Significant inferences of climate change spatial patterns are made after these non-parametric statistics of the multi-model ensemble median, while the associated uncertainties are quantified by the spread of these statistics across the multi-model ensemble. Significant and robust climate change inferences of the spatial patterns are then obtained by building the climate change patterns using only the grid points where a significant climate change is found with a predefined low uncertainty. Results highlight the importance of taking into account the spread across an ensemble of climate simulations when making inferences on climate change from the ensemble-mean or ensemble-median. This is specially true for climate projections of extreme indices such CDD and R95T. For PRCTOT, a decrease in annual precipitation over the entire peninsula is projected, specially in the north and northwest where it can decrease down to 400??mm by the middle of the 21st century. This decrease is expected to occur throughout the year except in winter. Annual CDD is projected to increase till the middle of the 21st century overall the peninsula, reaching more than three weeks in the southwest. This increase is projected to occur in summer and spring. For Rx5day, a decrease is projected to occur during spring and autumn in the major part of the peninsula, and during summer in northern Iberia. Finally, R95T is projected to decrease around 20\% in northern Iberia in summer, and around 15\% in the south-southwest in autumn.},

Biological invasions proceed through a series of transition probabilities (i.e., introduction, establishment, spread, and impact), and each of these presents opportunities for management. Recent research advances have improved estimates of probability and associated uncertainty. Improvements have come from species-specific trait-based risk assessments (of estimates of introduction, establishment, spread, and impact probabilities, especially from pathways of commerce in living organisms), spatially explicit dispersal models (introduction and spread, especially from transportation pathways), and species distribution models (establishment, spread, and impact). Results of these forecasting models combined with improved and cheaper surveillance technologies and practices [e.g., environmentalDNA( eDNA), drones, citizen science] enable more efficient management by focusing surveillance, prevention, eradication, and control efforts on the highest-risk species and locations. Bioeconomic models account for the interacting dynamics within and between ecological and economic systems, and allow decision makers to better understand the financial consequences of alternative management strategies. In general, recent research advances demonstrate that prevention is the policy with the greatest long-term net benefit.},

Furthermore by comparing collections of drosophilids from different European populations distributed along a latitudinal cline we were able to determine its high dispersal ability since it spread approximately 1400 km in 1 year either actively or passively through infested fruits. The similarities of the introduction dates in North America and Europe and the COI haplotypes suggest that the two invasions could be related. No considerable damage on crops has been reported yet in Europe. However, if this species gets established in more temperate localities it could become a serious pest. Therefore tracking the invasion of this species is recommended. An early detection of this potential pest is decisive for good management of the fields.},

Although these multiple benefits speak positively for urban greening programs, the programs do not take into account the drastic differences between urban and natural systems. Elevated temperatures together with anthropogenic emissions of air and water pollutants distinguish the urban system. Although the potential for emissions of volatile organic compounds from urban vegetation combined with anthropogenic emissions to produce ozone has long been recognized, the municipalities actively enlarging their green spaces still generally either overlook or ignore this fact. Here we assess the scientific evidence of biogenic induction of ground-level ozone concentrations in urban and sub-urban areas and argue that it is feasible and beneficial to implement measures necessary to limit biogenic contributions to air pollution. With the example of biogenic induction of ground level ozone concentrations we demonstrate that interactions between plants and urban ambient conditions have to be taken into account in all efforts of creating "naturopolises". We explore the mechanisms behind these interactions and propose a pathway to improve our understanding of these interactions.},

  abstract = {Urban areas' population has grown during the last century and it is expected that over 60\% of the world population will live in cities by 2050. Urban parks provide several ecosystem services that are valuable to the well-being of city-dwellers and they are also considered a nature-based solution to tackle multiple environmental problems in cities. However, the type and amount of ecosystem services provided will vary with each park vegetation type, even within same the park. Our main goal was to quantify the trade-offs in ecosystem services associated to different vegetation types, using a spatially detailed approach. Rather than relying solely on general vegetation typologies, we took a more ecologically oriented approach, by explicitly considering different units of vegetation structure and composition. This was demonstrated in a large park (44ha) located in the city of Almada (Lisbon metropolitan area, Portugal), where six vegetation units were mapped in detail and six ecosystem services were evaluated: carbon sequestration, seed dispersal, erosion prevention, water purification, air purification and habitat quality. The results showed that, when looking at the park in detail, some ecosystem services varied greatly with vegetation type. Carbon sequestration was positively influenced by tree density, independently of species composition. Seed dispersal potential was higher in lawns, and mixed forest provided the highest amount of habitat quality. Air purification service was slightly higher in mixed forest, but was high in all vegetation types, probably due to low background pollution, and both water purification and erosion prevention were high in all vegetation types. Knowing the type, location, and amount of ecosystem services provided by each vegetation type can help to improve management options based on ecosystem services trade-offs and looking for win-win situations. The trade-offs are, for example, very clear for carbon: tree planting will boost carbon sequestration regardless of species, but may not be enough to increase habitat quality. Moreover, it may also negatively influence seed dispersal service. Informed practitioners can use this ecological knowledge to promote the role of urban parks as a nature-based solution to provide multiple ecosystem services, and ultimately improve the design and management of the green infrastructure. This will also improve the science of Ecosystem Services, acknowledging that the type of vegetation matters for the provision of ecosystem services and trade-offs analysis.},

  abstract = {The carbon, phosphorus, and water cycles of a subtropical floodplain forest, and related ecosystem characteristics, were studied. Located at 750 m elevation in Puerto Rico (latitude 18? N) the forest had 27 tree species, 3059 stems/ha, a basal area of 42.4 m2/ha, maximum height of 17 m, and a leaf area index of 3.3. Palm (Prestoea montana) dominated the forest, and, with two other species, accounted for 68\% of the dominance. Throughfall, stemflow, interception, runoff, transpiration, and evapotranspiration accounted for 81.6, 9.8, 8.6, 77.7, 13.7, and 22.3\% of annual rainfall (3725 mm) respectively. The stand carbon storage was 28.77 kg/M2, distributed as follows: aboveground 35.4\%, vegetation 44.2\%, soil to 1 m depth 55\%, palms 10.9\%. Vegetation biomass was partitioned as follows: leaves 9.8\% (75\% are palm leaves), wood 68\%, and roots 21.8\%. Net aboveground primary carbon productivity (NPP) was 876 g-m-2 yr-'. Average litterfall was 2.4 g.m-2* d-' (palm leaves 32\%, other leaves 39\%, and wood 10\%). Half-lives of decaying material were 188, 306, 462, and 576 d, respectively, for palm leaves still attached to the parent tree, dicotyledonous leaves, palm leaves on the ground, and palm trunks. Total organic carbon concentrations in stream water increased with increasing stream discharge (from 2 g/m3 to 30 g/m3). Watershed export of carbon was 50 g-m-2 yr-' (including 12 g m-2 yr- I in the form of leaf litter). Mean P concentration in palm leaves (1.18 mg/g) was twice that in dicotyledonous leaves (0.64 mg/g). Compared to a rainfall phosphorus input to the watershed of 63 mg m-2 yr-', leaching from the canopy was high (167 mg.m-2 yr-'), as was the loss of P from the watershed (611 mg m-2 yr-'). Phosphorus-conserving mechanisms included a high rate of retranslocation in palms (504 mg m-2 yr-'). In spite of these mechanisms, there was a net P loss from the watershed that ranged from 136 to 544 mg iM-2 yr-'. Periodic flooding, poor soil aeration, intensive year-round rainfall, and low atmospheric saturation vapor pressure deficits are believed to be the main driving forces of the floodplain forest, which exhibits many characteristics typical of lowland rain forests and floodplain wetlands. Rates of NPP, litterfall, and biomass turnover (residence time of 14-17 yr) are faster than expected for the climatic conditions, whereas rates of wood production and storage of organic matter in the vegetation and soil profile are lower than expected for the climate.},

These accounts focus on the attempts of individuals to separate their life domains on social media. In contrast, we present the narratives of professional IT workers in India who intentionally disrupt the boundaries between personal and professional profiles in order to get noticed by their employers. Drawing on the dramaturgical vocabulary of Goffman (1959) we shed light on how individuals cope with increased levels of self-disclosure on social media. We argue that their self-presentations can be likened to post-modern performances in which the traditional boundaries between actor and audience are intentionally unsettled. These casual posts communicate additional personal traits that are not otherwise included in professional presentations. Since there are no strict boundaries between formal front-stage and relaxed back-stage regions in these types of performance, a liminal mental state is often used, which enables a better assessment of the type of information to present on social media.},

  abstract = {The presence of invasive species is often not realized until well after the species becomes established. Discovering the location and extent of infestation before the invasive species causes widespread damage typically requires intensive monitoring efforts. In this paper, we analyze the problem of controlling an invasive species when there is imperfect information about the degree of infestation. We model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process in which the decision-maker receives an imperfect signal about the level of infestation. The decision-maker then chooses a management action to minimize expected costs based on beliefs about the level of infestation. We apply this model to a simple application with three possible levels of infestation where the decision-maker can choose to take no action, only monitor, only treat, or do both monitoring and treatment jointly. We solve for optimal management as a function of beliefs about the level of infestation. For a case with positive monitoring and treatment costs, we find that the optimal policy involves choosing no action when there is a sufficiently large probability of no infestation, monitoring alone with intermediate probability values and treatment alone when the probability of moderate or high infestation is large. We also show how optimal management and expected costs change as the cost or quality of information from monitoring changes. With costless and perfect monitoring, expected costs are 20-30\% lower across the range of belief states relative to the expected costs without monitoring. \textcopyright{} 2010.},

  abstract = {Quantifying economic damages caused by invasive species is crucial for cost-benefit analyses of biosecurity measures. Most studies focus on short-term damage estimates, but evaluating exclusion or prevention measures requires estimates of total anticipated damages from the time of establishment onward. The magnitude of such damages critically depends on the timing of damages relative to a species' arrival because costs are discounted back to the time of establishment. Using theoretical simulations, we illustrate how (ceteris paribus) total long-term damages, and hence the benefits of prevention efforts, are greater for species that a) have short lags between introduction and spread or between arrival at a location and initiation of damages, b) cause larger, short-lived damages (as opposed to smaller, persistent damages), and c) spread faster or earlier. We empirically estimate total long-term discounted impacts for three forest pests currently invading North America - gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae), and emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) - and discuss how damage persistence, lags between introduction and spread, and spread rates affect damages. Many temporal characteristics can be predicted for new invaders and should be considered in species risk analyses and economic evaluations of quarantine and eradication programs.},

In terms of alien species diversity within invertebrate orders, this result ranks Hymenoptera third following Coleoptera and Hemiptera. Two third of alien Hymenoptera are parasitoids or hyperparasitoids that were mostly introduced for biological control purposes. Only 35 phytophagous species, 47 predator species and 3 species of pollinators have been introduced. Six families of wasps (Aphelinidae, Encyrtidae, Eulophidae, Braconidae, Torymidae, Pteromalidae) represent together with ants (Formicidae) about 80\% of the alien Hymenoptera introduced to Europe. Th e three most diverse families are Aphelinidae (60 species representing 32\% of the Aphelinid European fauna), Encyrtidae (55) and Formicidae (42) while the Chalcidoidea together represents 2/3 of the total Hymenoptera species introduced to Europe. Th e fi rst two families are associated with mealy-bugs, a group that also included numerous aliens to Europe. In addition, they are numerous cases of Hy-menoptera introduced from one part of Europe to another, especially from continental Europe to British Islands.

Using a common protocol, we present the first multicountry estimates of the direct and indirect costs of dengue cases in eight American and Asian countries. We conducted prospective studies of the cost of dengue in five countries in the Americas (Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, and Venezuela) and three countries in Asia (Cambodia, Malaysia, and Thailand). All studies followed the same core protocol with interviews and medical record reviews. The study populations were patients treated in ambulatory and hospital settings with a clinical diagnosis of dengue. Most studies were performed in 2005. Costs are in 2005 international dollars (I\$). We studied 1,695 patients (48\% pediatric and 52\% adult); none died. The average illness lasted 11.9 days for ambulatory patients and 11.0 days for hospitalized patients. Among hospitalized patients, students lost 5.6 days of school, whereas those working lost 9.9 work days per average dengue episode. Overall mean costs were I\$514 and I\$1,394 for an ambulatory and hospitalized case, respectively. With an annual average of 574,000 cases reported, the aggregate annual economic cost of dengue for the eight study countries is at least I\$587 million. Preliminary adjustment for under-reporting could raise this total to \$1.8 billion, and incorporating costs of dengue surveillance and vector control would raise the amount further.

(Arecales: Arecaceae), is an important palm species cultivated since pre-historic times in the arid regions of the world and traditionally associated with the life and culture of the people in the Middle-East and North Africa which are the pre-dominant date palm growing regions worldwide. The crop is currently cultivated in nearly 30 countries in the Asian, African, American and Australasian continents. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN estimates that there are over 100 million date palms world wide with an annual production of over 7.5 million tonnes Date palm is attacked by a wide range of insect pests mainly from the orders Coleoptera, Lepidoptera and Hemiptera besides phytophagous mites, several of which cause substantial loss in yield and even mortality of palms. During the last two decades there has been a significant increase in date palm cultivation worldwide especially in the Middle-East and North Africa where the area has increased over 50\%, mostly in vast stretches of monoculture plantations offering a conducive macro and micro ha bitat for existing and emerging insect pests of date palm. Global warming together with rapid large scale movement of palm species for farming and ornamental gardening has compounded the threat of insect pests to date palm. Indiscriminate use of insecticides to control these pests as the first line of defense is of major concern in the date growing countries due to the inherent disadvantages of insecticidal residues in dates (affecting exports), development of resistance to insecticides in the target species and resurgence of minor pest to major insect pest associated with chemical control The book provides an overview on the biology (life cycle, damage, losses, geographical distribution, host range) and management (monitoring, action thresholds, biological control, chemical control, mechanical control, use of semiochemicals and biopesticides) of major arthropod pests of date palm from the orders Coleoptera (red palm weevil, long horn beetle, rhinoceros beetle, frond borer, sap beetles), Hemiptera (dubas bug, issid bug, scale insects, mealy bug) and Lepidoptera (lesser date moth, carob moth, raisin moth), and mites. The issues pertaining to the role of semiochemicals in date pest management and innovative methods for managing storage pests of dates are also addressed.

Results indicate that there are similarities between cities regarding attitudes towards ES provision and the importance of different park characteristics for visitors. Park use patterns such as the share of regular park visitors or the activities carried out, however, vary significantly between cities. The city-specific context, including park availability, quality, and perception but also the inhabitants' preferences for cultural ES and existing substitutes, is thus crucial for urban planning.},

The uninfested landscape is divided into two zones, characterized by different dynamically optimal management plans: a suppression zone and an eradication zone. In the suppression zone, optimal detection effort increases with distance from the front.

While traditional stormwater management has relied on gray infrastructure such as piped conveyances to collect and convey stormwater to wastewater treatment facilities or into surface waters, cities are exploring green infrastructure to manage stormwater at its source. Decentralized green infrastructure leverages the capabilities of soil and vegetation to infiltrate, redistribute, and otherwise store stormwater volume, with the potential to realize ancillary environmental, social, and economic benefits. To date, green infrastructure science and practice have largely focused on infiltration-based technologies that include rain gardens, bioswales, and permeable pavements. However, a narrow focus on infiltration overlooks other losses from the hydrologic cycle, and we propose that arboriculture \textendash{} the cultivation of trees and other woody plants \textendash{} deserves additional consideration as a stormwater control measure. Trees interact with the urban hydrologic cycle by intercepting incoming precipitation, removing water from the soil via transpiration, enhancing infiltration, and bolstering the performance of other green infrastructure technologies. However, many of these interactions are inadequately understood, particularly at spatial and temporal scales relevant to stormwater management. As such, the reliable use of trees for stormwater control depends on improved understanding of how and to what extent trees interact with stormwater, and the context-specific consideration of optimal arboricultural practices and institutional frameworks to maximize the stormwater benefits trees can provide.},

Methods differ in their aims; from mapping and modelling the supply and demand of ecosystem services to appraising their economic and non-economic importance through valuation techniques. A key challenge in method selection is to understand the requirements of different decision-making contexts and what is gained in moving from simple to more complex approaches. This paper addresses this challenge using the experience from 27 case studies which applied different biophysical, socio-cultural and monetary valuation methods to operationalise the ecosystem service concept towards sustainable land, water and urban management. A survey of the reasons why the case study teams selected particular methods revealed that stakeholder-oriented reasons, such as stakeholder participation, inclusion of local knowledge and ease of communication, and decision-oriented reasons, such as the purpose of the case study and the ecosystem services at stake, were key considerations in selecting a method. Pragmatic reasons such as available data, resources and expertise were also important factors. This information was used to develop a set of linked decision trees, which aim to provide guidance to researchers and practitioners in choosing ecosystem service assessment methods that are suitable for their context.},

These results reveal differences among the above populations in major demographic traits, such as longevity and reproduction schedule, and behavioural ones, such as male sexual signalling. In all biotypes and under constant laboratory conditions males outlived females. However, the gender gap in longevity differed a great deal among biotypes. Con- sidering female longevity medfly biotypes obtained from Guatemala, Kenya and Hawaii are classified as short lived, and those from Greece, Portugal and Brazil as long lived. Nevertheless, taking into consideration male longevity, Kenyan and Hawaiian flies are grouped with Greek, Brazilian and Portuguese (long lived) and only Guatemalan males are classified as short lived. We also reviewed biological and behavioural data derived from wild medfly populations, and combined them with existing information on the Mediterranean fruit fly population genetics and global invasion history aiming at understanding shifts in demo- graphic and behavioural traits in this important pest.},

The interactions between plants and their natural enemies are influenced by environmental conditions and thus global warming and climate change could affect CPP ranges and impact. Observations of changing CPP distributions over the twentieth century suggest that growing agricultural production and trade have been most important in disseminating CPPs, but there is some evidence for a latitudinal bias in range shifts that indicates a global warming signal. Species distribution models using climatic variables as drivers suggest that ranges will shift latitudinally in the future. The rapid spread of the Colorado potato beetle across Eurasia illustrates the importance of evolutionary adaptation, host distribution, and migration patterns in affecting the predictions of climate-based species distribution models. Understanding species range shifts in the framework of ecological niche theory may help to direct future research needs.},

  abstract = {The publication of the fourth IPCC report, as well as the number of research results reported in recent years about the regionalization of climate projections, were the driving forces to justify the update of the report on climate change in Catalonia. Specifically, the new IPCC report contains new climate projections at global and continental scales, while several international projects (especially European projects PRUDENCE and ENSEMBLES) have produced continental-scale climate projections, which allow for distinguishing between European regions. For Spain, some of these results have been included in a document commissioned by the"State Agency of Meteorology". In addition, initiatives are being developed within Catalonia (in particular, by the Meteorological Service of Catalonia) to downscale climate projections in this area. The present paper synthesizes results of these and other previously published studies, as well as our own analysis of results of the ENSEMBLES project. The aim is to propose scenarios of variation in temperature and rainfall in Catalonia during the 21st Century. Thus, by the middle of this century temperatures could rise up to 2 C compared with that of the late 20th Century. These increases would probably be higher in summer than in winter, generalized across the territory but less pronounced in coastal areas. Rainfall, however, would not change much, but it could slightly decrease. Towards the end of the 21st Century, temperatures could rise to about 5 C above that of the last century, while the average rainfall could decrease by more than 10\%. Increases in temperature would be higher in summer and in areas further from the coast. Rainfall would decrease especially during the summer, while it could even increase in winter in mountainous areas such as the Pyrenees. \textcopyright{} 2012 Author(s).},

  abstract = {The use of simple terms to articulate ecological concepts can confuse ideological debates and undermine management efforts. This problem is particularly acute in studies of nonindigenous species, which alternatively have been called `exotic', `introduced', `invasive' and `naturalised', among others. Attempts to redefine commonly used terminology have proven difficult because authors are often partial to particular definitions. In an attempt to form a consensus on invasion terminology, we synthesize an invasional framework based on current models that break the invasion process into a series of consecutive, obligatory stages. Unlike previous efforts, we propose a neutral terminology based on this framework. This `stagebased' terminology can be used to supplement terms with ambiguous meanings (e.g. invasive, introduced, naturalized, weedy, etc.), and thereby improve clarity of future studies. This approach is based on the concept of `propagule pressure' and has the additional benefit of identifying factors affecting the success of species at each stage. Under this framework, invasions can be more objectively understood as biogeographical, rather than taxonomic, phenomena; and author preferences in the use of existing terminology can be addressed. An example of this recommended protocol might be: `We examined distribution data to contrast the characteristics of invasive species (stages IVa and V) and noninvasive species (stages III and IVb)'.},

Regional land use/ land cover and tree canopy cover were parameterized with data obtained by remote sensing and ground sampling. Annual interception was 1.1\% for the entire county and 11.1\% of precipitation falling on the urban forest canopy. Summer interception at the urban forest canopy level was 36\% for an urban forest stand dominated by large, broadleaf evergreens and conifers (leaf area index = 6.1) and 18\% for a stand dominated by medium-sized conifers and broadleaf deciduous trees (leaf area index = 3.7). For 5 precipitation events with return frequencies ranging from 2 to 200 years, interception was greatest for small storms and least for large storms. Because small storms are responsible for most pollutant washout, urban forests are likely to produce greater benefits through water quality protection than through flood control.},

  abstract = {Stage-structured models that integrate demography and dispersal can be used to identify points in the life cycle with large effects on rates of population spatial spread, information that is vital in the development of containment strategies for invasive species. Current challenges in the application of these tools include: (1) accounting for large uncertainty in model parameters, which may violate assumptions of "local" perturbation metrics such as sensitivities and elasticities, and (2) forecasting not only asymptotic rates of spatial spread, as is usually done, but also transient spatial dynamics in the early stages of invasion. We developed an invasion model for the Diaprepes root weevil (DRW; Diaprepes abbreviatus [Coleoptera: Curculionidae]), a generalist herbivore that has invaded citrus-growing regions of the United States. We synthesized data on DRW demography and dispersal and generated predictions for asymptotic and transient peak invasion speeds, accounting for parameter uncertainty. We quantified the contributions of each parameter toward invasion speed using a "global" perturbation analysis, and we contrasted parameter contributions during the transient and asymptotic phases. We found that the asymptotic invasion speed was 0.02-0.028 km/week, although the transient peak invasion speed (0.03-0.045 km/week) was significantly greater. Both asymptotic and transient invasions speeds were most responsive to weevil dispersal distances. However, demographic parameters that had large effects on asymptotic speed (e.g., survival of early-instar larvae) had little effect on transient speed. Comparison of the global analysis with lower-level elasticities indicated that local perturbation analysis would have generated unreliable predictions for the responsiveness of invasion speed to underlying parameters. Observed range expansion in southern Florida (1992-2006) was significantly lower than the invasion speed predicted by the model. Possible causes of this mismatch include overestimation of dispersal distances, demographic rates, and spatiotemporal variation in parameter values. This study demonstrates that, when parameter uncertainty is large, as is often the case, global perturbation analyses are needed to identify which points in the life cycle should be targets of management. Our results also suggest that effective strategies for reducing spread during the asymptotic phase may have little effect during the transient phase.},

We find that countries vary in terms of potential threat from invasive species and also their role as potential sources, with apparently similar countries sometimes varying markedly depending on specifics of agricultural commodities and trade patterns. Overall, the biggest agricultural producers (China and the United States) could experience the greatest absolute cost from further species invasions. However, developing countries, in particular, Sub-Saharan African countries, appear most vulnerable in relative terms. Furthermore, China and the United States represent the greatest potential sources of invasive species for the rest of the world.

Stronger place values were related with low management intensity, while values for tourism increase with land-uses embedding cultural facilities.

  abstract = {Insects are among the world's most ecologically and economically important invasive species. Here we assemble inventories of native and non-native species from 20 world regions and contrast relative numbers among these species assemblages. Multivariate ordination indicates that the distribution of species among insect orders is completely different between native and non-native assemblages. Some orders, such as the Psocoptera, Dictyoptera, Siphonaptera, Thysanoptera, and Hemiptera, are always over-represented in the non-native compared to native assemblages. Other orders, such as the Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Odonata, Mecoptera and Microcoryphila, are consistently under-represented in non-native assemblages. These patterns most likely arise both as a result of variation among taxa in their association with invasion pathways responsible for transporting species among world regions, as well as variation in life-history traits that affect establishment potential. However, our results indicate that species compositions associated with invasiveness are fundamentally different from compositions related to insularity, indicating that colonization of islands selects for a different group of insect taxa than does selection for successful invaders. Native and non-native assemblage compositions were also related, to a lesser extent, to latitude of the region sampled. Together, these results illustrate the dominant role of invasion pathways in shaping the composition of non-native insect assemblages. They also emphasize the difference between natural background colonization of islands and anthropogenic colonization events, and imply that biological invasions are not a simple subset of a long-standing ecological process.},

Volumetric Hirst type spore traps recorded pollen levels continuously for three years. Ornamental street trees in the study area were identified, counted and mapped. Airborne pollen records were found to be related to the number of trees, the proximity of the trees to traps, the different pollination systems and wind direction. A total of 17635 trees, from all localities were counted, belonging to 67 species, 58\% anemophilous, 22\% entomophilous, and 20\% both pollination systems.

Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts $\sim$8.7 million ($\pm$ 1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which $\sim$2.2 million ($\pm$ 0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86\% of existing species on Earth and 91\% of species in the ocean still await description. Renewed interest in further exploration and taxonomy is required if this significant gap in our knowledge of life on Earth is to be closed.},

All species are subject to control by Swedish public authorities, and estimates for most AIS include either damage cost or actual control cost. The results indicate a total annual cost between approximately 1620 and 5080 million SEK, which correspond to SEK 175 and SEK 565 per capita in Sweden. The estimates are well within the range of similar calculations for other countries, but differ with respect to the composition of costs of different AIS. Whereas costs for the agricultural and forestry sectors dominate in most other studies, the costs of AIS in Sweden are more equally divided among different categories. The results also indicate that the highest costs are attributable to unintentionally introduced AIS and that the most reliable cost estimates are related to human and animal health.},

Thus, the European region includes all countries from Iceland in the west to the Russian Federation (west of the Urals) and the Caspian Sea in the east, and from the northern shores of the Mediterranean and Black Seas and the Caucasus in the south to the Arctic Ocean in the north. Impacts above the Arctic Circle are addressed in Chapter 28 and impacts in the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas in Chapter 30. Impacts in Malta, Cyprus, and other island states in Europe are discussed in Chapter 29. The European region has been divided into five sub-regions (see Figure 23-1): Atlantic, Alpine, Southern, Northern, and Continental. The sub-regions are derived by aggregating the climate zones developed by Metzger et al. (2005) and therefore represent geographical and ecological zones rather than political boundaries. The scientific evidence has been evaluated to compare impacts across (rather than within) sub-regions, although this was not always possible depending on the scientific information available.},

  abstract = {Green Infrastructure (GI) practices have shown to be promising in mitigating the air pollution in urban areas of several cities across the world. GI practices such as trees, green roofs and green walls are widely used in United States and Europe to mitigate the air pollution. However, there is yet limited knowledge available in identifying the most suitable GI strategy for an urban area in improving the air quality. Furthermore, it is evident that Australia is still lagging behind in adapting GI to mitigate air pollution, compared with US and Europe. Therefore, this study analyzed the air quality improvement through several GI scenarios consisting of trees, green roofs and green walls considering a case study area in Melbourne, Australia by using the i-Tree Eco software. The results were compared with case studies in different cities across the world. The results showed that the i-Tree Eco software can be successfully applied to an Australian case study area to quantify the air quality improvement benefits of GI. The results were further assessed with several environmental, economic and social indicators to identify the most suitable GI scenarios for the study area. These indicators were quantified using different methods, to assess the effectiveness of different GI scenarios. The results showed that, trees provided the highest air pollution removal capability among the different GI considered for the study area. Combination of different GI such as green roofs and green walls with trees did not provide a significant increment of air quality improvement however, has provided more local benefits such as building energy savings. The results obtained from this study were also beneficial in developing policies related to future GI applications in major cities of Australia for the air quality improvement.},

  abstract = {Red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) is a key pest of date palm Phoenix dactylifera L and continues to spread among and within date palm plantation countries. Globally, R. ferrugineus has the widest geographical range among the genus of Rhynchophorus weevils and is known to cause complete destruction of palms often resulting in widespread damage to entire grooves of cultivated date palms. Since R. ferrugineus was first recognized as a threat to date palm production in the mid 1980s for GCC countries, scientists and growers have deployed several methods to control this destructive pest, with the use of chemical insecticides being the main strategy until the synthesis of the male aggregation pheromone in 1993. This article reviews the current literature on different control methods to evaluate the effectiveness of various control options and proposes an overall strategy to manage R. ferrugineus in date palm. The R. ferrugineus control methods include prospects of early detection techniques, role of phyto-sanitation and agro-techniques (palm and field sanitation, palm injury prevention, elimination of hidden breeding sites including abandoned date plantations), semiochemicals and insecticide applications in preventive and curative treatments. Further, case studies of area-wide R. ferrugineus management in date palm besides the potential of biological control methods particularly with regard to the use of entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes and also the role of regulatory methods to regulate transport and transfer of infested palm trees (domestic and international quarantine) is presented. A review of the available control methodologies suggests that R. ferrugineus can be managed by deploying an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy comprising of several tactics including regulatory methods, behaviour manipulation involving insect aggregation pheromones for monitoring and mass trapping adult weevils, chemical and biological control, crop and field sanitation, eliminating hidden breeding sites, manipulation of cultural practices involving in-groove humidity and palm density, frond and offshoot removal, besides regular dissemination of R. ferrugineus-IPM technologies among farmers and pest managers.},

The majority of these studies were published in the last 8-\dbend{}years and nearly two-thirds were carried out in North America. These publications concerned 72 invasive insect species, of which two ant species, Solenopsis invicta and Linepithema humile, accounted for 18\% and 14\% of the studies, respectively. Most publications investigated effects on native biodiversity at population or community level. Genetic effects and, to a lesser extent, effects on ecosystem services and processes were rarely explored. We review the effects caused by different insect invaders according to: their ecosystem roles, i.e. herbivores, predators, parasites, parasitoids and pollinators; the level of biological organisation at which they occur; and the direct and indirect mechanisms underlying these effects. The best documented effects occur in invasive ants, Eurasian forest herbivores invasive in North America, and honeybees. Impacts may occur through simple trophic interactions such as herbivory, predation or parasitism. Alien species may also affect native species and communities through more complex mechanisms such as competition for resources, disease transmission, apparent competition, or pollination disruption, among others. Finally, some invasive insects, particularly forest herbivores and ants, are known to affect ecosystem processes through cascading effects. We identify biases and gaps in our knowledge of ecological effects of invasive insects and suggest further opportunities for research},

In 2010, palm oil accounted for 36.5\% of the world's vegetable oil production and it is projected to be the leading vegetable oil in the world by 2016. As the Malaysian palm oil industry is committed to delivering sustainable palm oil products to meet customer demand, this research was to enable identification and prioritisation of areas for improvement. As an example, the Roadmap of Malaysian Palm Oil Industry 2009-2020 was finalised as one of its strategies to attain sustainable production of palm oil and improvement in the quality of planet, people and profit. These include the implementations of Environment Management Systems (since 2004) and National Life Cycle Assessment Project (since 2006). The implementation of carbon footprint labelling is currently being carried out under the National Carbon Footprint Labelling Scheme (2011-2015) by the Standards and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM) as part of continuous improvements for the delivery of sustainable palm oil products. Current approaches used for governing sustainable palm oil products are unsatisfactory due to limitations such as lack of potential impact models, data availability and uncertainty of impact results. Hence, this research addressed the need to improve understanding of having clear information requirements based on the different impacts in the Malaysian palm oil industry supply network tiers. Simulation experiments were then used to explore the aggregation of these information requirements across the Malaysian palm oil industry supply network. Agent-based and system dynamics modelling techniques were applied to simulate the behaviours of different entities and their interactions in the plantation, mill and mill-refinery models. These simulation techniques were able to build understanding on how information could be linked throughout the different tiers in the supply network. In order to have significant results, the output of the models of each tier must be linked (e.g. the mill and refinery models were linked together).},

Involving citizens on the natural resource management using public participation processes is crucial. The case study of a small town of Sicily (Italy) was treated and the spread of this pest was monitored.

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.Globalization is triggering an increase in the establishment of alien insects in Europe, with several species having substantial ecological and economic impacts. We investigated long-term changes in rates of species spread following establishment. We used the total area of countries invaded by 1171 insect species for which the date of first record in Europe is known, to estimate their current range radius (calculated as [invaded area]0.5/$\pi$). We estimated initial rates of radial spread and compared them among different groups of insects for all years (1800\textendash{}2014) and for a subset of more recent decades (1950\textendash{}2014). Accidentally introduced species spread faster than intentionally introduced species. Considering the whole period 1800\textendash{}2014, spread patterns also differ between feeding guilds, with decreasing spread rates over residence time in herbivores but not in detritivores or parasitic species. These decreases for herbivorous species appeared mainly in those associated with herbaceous plants and crops rather than woody plants. Initial spread rate was significantly greater for species detected after 1990, roughly 3\textendash{}4 times higher than for species that arrived earlier. We hypothesize that the political changes in Europe following the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1989, and the further dismantling of customs checkpoints within an enlarged European Union (EU) have facilitated the faster spread of alien insect species. Also, the number of species first recorded in the Eastern Bloc of the politically-divided Europe before 1989 was lower than for the rest of Europe. A detailed analysis of six recent invaders indicated a dominant role of long-distance translocations related to human activities, especially with the plant trade, in determining rates of spread.},

There were no significant differences between burst\$$\backslash$backslash\$nrates in enclosed and open environments, but the shielding provided by\$$\backslash$backslash\$nthe enclosure enabled detection of early instars from greater distances.\$$\backslash$backslash\$nThus, there is potential to use acoustic technology to detect early RPW\$$\backslash$backslash\$ninfestation in either minimally shielded or open environments. In\$$\backslash$backslash\$naddition, because late-instar impulses ranged to higher amplitude and\$$\backslash$backslash\$nhad greater diversity of spectral features than with early instars, it\$$\backslash$backslash\$nmay be possible to identify late-instar infestations based on the\$$\backslash$backslash\$namplitudes and the diversity of sound features detected.},

Next we discuss the relevance of our results in relation to critical policy challenges, such as the promotion of societal cohesion and healthy lifestyles. Data were collected through 44 semi-structured interviews and a survey among 201 users of 27 urban gardens in Barcelona, Spain, as well as from consultation meetings with local planners. We identified 20 ecosystem services, ranging from food production over pollination to social cohesion and environmental learning. Among them, cultural ecosystem services (non-material benefits people derive from their interaction with nature) \mbox{} stand out as the most widely perceived and as the most highly valued. The main beneficiaries of ecosystem services from urban gardens are elder, low-middle income, and migrant people. Our results about the societal importance of urban gardens \mbox{}were deemed highly relevant by the interviewed green space planners in Barcelona, who noted that our data can provide basis to support or expand existing gardening programs in the city. Our research further suggests that ecosystem services from urban gardens can play an important role in addressing several urban policy challenges in cities, such as promoting stewardship of urban ecosystems, providing opportunities for recreation and healthy lifestyles, and promoting social cohesion.

  title = {The Economic Cost of Invasive Non-Native Species on {{Great Britain}}},
  abstract = {The impact of Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) can be manifold, ranging from loss of crops, damaged buildings, and additional production costs to the loss of livelihoods and ecosystem services. INNS are increasingly abundant in Great Britain and in Europe generally and their impact is rising. Hence, INNS are the subject of considerable concern in Great Britain, prompting the development of a Non-Native Species Strategy and the formation of the GB Non-Native Species Programme Board and Secretariat. A number of estimates of the economic impact of INNS on various countries, including the UK, exist, but the detail in many of these estimates is lacking and the impact on different sectors of the country is largely unknown. This research estimates the current annual cost of INNS to the British economy. The report provides assessments of the economic cost of INNS to twelve sectors and the report contains detailed examples for three species (Japanese knotweed, signal crayfish and floating pennywort). Five case studies are also included to demonstrate the costs of eradication at different stages of invasion. The report only considers negative economic impacts of INNS, although it is acknowledged that non-native species, including some invasive ones can make a positive contribution to the economy. Various methods were used to secure data for economic estimations. References of relevance to over 500 non-native species were gathered from the scientific and grey literature as well as the internet. A detailed questionnaire was sent to key organisations, primarily to develop contacts but also to gather initial information. The collected information was used to estimate the costs, partially based on calculations for individual species, which was anonymously reviewed by selected experts from each of the sectors. The total current annual cost of INNS to the British economy is estimated, when corrected for double counting, at 1,291,461,000 to England, 244,736,000 to Scotland and 125,118,000 to Wales. Therefore the total annual cost of INNS to the British economy is estimated at approximately 1.7 billion. In this work, where solid evidence was not available, assumptions based on the biology and ecology of the species involved were used to extrapolate costs. When assumptions had to be used, the figures that were used were intentionally conservative and it has been explicitly stated that they were assumptions. In the anonymous peer review process the calculations and assumptions were challenged, corrected or accepted. This report focused on direct costs as these could be most accurately estimated, however if indirect costs do exist to a similar extent to that found in the meta-analysis, the value of these could be very significant. However, the indirect costs have not been sufficiently explored to support or refute this suggestion. As INNS are becoming more widespread and the economic impact is expected to increase, the effect of the extent of the invasion on control costs was investigated in five case studies (Asian long-horned beetle, carpet sea squirt, water primrose, grey squirrel and coypu). These case studies revealed an exponential increase of the cost of control as an invasion progresses, and demonstrated the benefits of intervention at an early stage, as well as the long-term cost savings if eradication is undertaken early in the invasion process.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n},

Timely intervention to control the spread of invaders can minimize economic and ecological damages, whereas lapses or delays in funding weed control can be extremely costly in the long run. Using recent decreases in funding for invasive plant management in California as an example, we argue that managers must make a broader case for investing in the control of invasive species to prevent the loss of ecosystem services. In particular, managers need to partner with academic scientists, private landowners, and the public sector to quantify the impact of invasive weeds on service provision, assess where services are most at risk and who benefits from the avoided cost of weed control, and create mechanisms to fund invasive species management through payment for ecosystem services.},

The International Plant Protection Convention (FAO) has begun the process of harmonizing standards for pest risk analysis to minimise the spread of exotic pests without adversely impacting global trade. However if the impacts of insect invasive species on human health and on agriculture have attracted worldwide attention, researchers and policymakers address directly the connection between invasive species and damage to natural and cultural heritages. The cost of these losses is generally neglected or underestimated. Various attempts have been made to treat the plants or the wood that affected by invasive species. But studies of the links between these pests and their effects on natural biodiversity and heritage, in botanical and historical gardens, are largely lacking in the literature. This paper examines categories of pest risk threatening the Mediterranean, with special emphasis on the author's homeland. We report the case of the invasive species Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Red Palm Weevil, RPW) recently introduced into Europe. With an interdisciplinary approach, and by focusing on the situation in Sicily, we analyse how the RPW could be considered not only a pest impacting palm trees, but also natural and cultural assets and heritage. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

It should be recognised, however, that although valuation techniques have been refined and linked to reliability protocols, they remain imperfect and for some commentators controversial.

We address two obstacles to local implementation of optimal regional control of a bio-invasion that damages public and private resources across jurisdictions: lack of local funds to protect the public resource and lack of access to protect the private resource. To evaluate these obstacles, we develop a spatial-dynamic model of the optimal control of emerald ash borer (EAB) in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota, USA. We focus on managing valuable host trees with preventative insecticide treatment or pre-emptive removal to slow EAB spread. The model includes spatial variation in the ownership and benefits of host trees, the costs of management, and the budgets of municipal jurisdictions. We develop and evaluate centralized strategies for 17 jurisdictions surrounding the infestation. The central planner determines the quantities of trees in public ownership to treat and remove over time, to maximize benefits of surviving trees net costs of management across public and private ownerships, subject to constraints on municipal budgets, management activities, and access to private trees. The results suggest that centralizing the budget across jurisdictions rather than increasing any one municipal budget does more to increase total net benefits. Strategies with insecticide treatment are superior to ones with pre-emptive removal because they reduce the quantity of susceptible trees at lower cost and protect the benefits of healthy trees. Increasing the accessibility of private trees to public management substantially slows EAB spread and improves total net benefit. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Values for avoiding impacts on three particular land uses have been assessed in this study with discrete choice experiments. The results indicated that on a per hectare basis, the value estimates to avoid infestation in public areas (schools and parks), were much higher than for private areas (housing) or natural bushland areas (protected native vegetation). There were high levels of support for eradication rather than containment strategies, despite the additional costs involved.

The aim of this study is to value implicitly non-priced urban forest amenities by comparing dwelling prices and specific amounts of amenities associated with dwelling units. The empirical study is based on data from the sales of terraced houses in the district of Salo in Finland. According to the estimation results a one kilometer increase in the distance to the nearest forested area leads to an average 5.9 percent decrease in the market price of the dwelling. Dwellings with a view onto forests are on average 4.9 percent more expensive than dwellings with otherwise similar characteristics. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

  abstract = {As an increasing proportion of the global human population resides in urban areas, urban forests are becoming both more important and more threatened. In many cities urban tree cover conflicts with strategies for urban intensification, and is being reduced due to inadequate protection. Here, we assess the effectiveness of one type of tree protection policy used by a number of cities worldwide: the case-by-case protection of specific individual trees. We use Auckland, New Zealand as a case study, where the main form of urban tree protection is now through Auckland Council's Schedule of Notable Trees. We investigated: (1) the species composition of the listed trees, and (2) the relative contribution of geographical variables (suburb age, dwelling density, socio-economic deprivation, and tree cover) in explaining spatial variation in listed-tree density. Tree cover ($\backslash$textgreater8. m) in central Auckland was 6\% of the land area, 63.2\% of which was on private land. Of these trees, approximately 15\% were protected. The tree species protected reflected cultural heritage; popular species were protected in large numbers, whilst only a single individual of a threatened native species was protected. The highest numbers of listed trees were in older suburbs, those with higher density housing, and those with lower levels of socio-economic deprivation. A low correlation between vegetation cover and listed-tree density shows that the proportion of trees protected varies substantially in different areas. We conclude that this case-by-case tree protection strategy provides insufficient protection for Auckland's urban biodiversity, but better implementation would improve biodiversity and social outcomes.},

However, efforts to integrate more sophisticated information into the analytical framework to help identify important ecosystem services have lagged in practice. This is problematic because understanding the tradeoffs of land consumption patterns on ecological integrity is central to mitigating the environmental degradation caused by land use change and new development. In this paper we describe how an ecosystem services valuation model, i-Tree, was integrated into a mainstream scenario planning software tool, Envision Tomorrow, to assess the benefits of public street trees for alternative future development scenarios. The tool is then applied to development scenarios from the City of Hutto, TX, a Central Texas Sustainable Places Project demonstration community. The integrated tool represents a methodological improvement for scenario planning practice, offers a way to incorporate ecosystem services analysis into mainstream planning processes, and serves as an example of how open source software tools can expand the range of issues available for community and regional planning consideration, even in cases where community resources are limited. The tool also offers room for future improvements; feasible options include canopy analysis of various future land use typologies, as well as a generalized street tree model for broader U.S. application.},

Second, we review the roles of interspecific competition, apparent competition, predation, intraguild predation and climatic limitation as causes of impacts on residents or as barriers to invasion. We concentrate on the best-studied invasive mosquito, Aedes albopictus, evaluating the application of basic ecological theory to invasions by Aedes albopictus. We develop a model based on observations of Aedes albopictus for effects of resource competition and predation as barriers to invasion, evaluating which community and ecosystem characteristics favour invasion. Third, we evaluate the ways in which invasive mosquitoes have contributed to outbreaks of human and animal disease, considering specifically whether invasive mosquitoes create novel health threats, or modify disease transmission for existing pathogen-host systems.},

  abstract = {Aim Non-native invasive insects have major impacts on ecosystem function, agricultural production and human health. To predict the geographical distributions of these species, correlative ecological niche models (ENMs) are typically used. Such methods rely on assumptions of niche conservatism, although there is increasing evidence that many species undergo niche shifts during invasions. The magnitude and direction of niche shifts, however, is likely to vary within and between taxonomic groups, highlighting that an assessment of potential niche shifts in such insects is required. Location Global. Time period Current. Major taxa studied Insects. Methods We compile a novel database of 22 globally invasive, non-native insect species and test for niche expansion and unfilling across this group. We examine if factors such as the native range size, poleward shifts and human influence may be associated with observed niche changes. Finally, we construct ENMs and examine the reliability of their predictions in light of our niche shift results. Results Niche expansion was apparent in 12 of the 22 species, suggesting that altered species\textendash{}climate relationships during invasion is common for this group. Likewise, niche unfilling occurred in 15 of the species. Increasing human disturbance (combining human population, transport networks and land use) explained 40\% of observed niche expansions and 54\% of incidents of niche unfilling. Niche metrics and ENM performance were sensitive to the choice of background extents. Main conclusions Many non-native insects expand into new climates in their invasive ranges. The prevalence of niche unfilling across this group suggests climate disequilibrium and the potential for further range expansion. Non-native invasive insects tend to invade areas with similar human disturbance to their native range, and habitat accessibility appears important for these species to achieve their full invasion range potential. Ideally, ENMs should not be used in isolation for this group, but should be coupled with other methods or experiments to test for potential niche change.},

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the impact of tourism and outdoor recreation on non-native species in terrestrial, marine and freshwater environments. Our results provide quantitative evidence that the abundance and richness of non-native species are significantly higher in sites where tourist activities take place than in control sites. The pattern was consistent across terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments; across a variety of vectors (e.g. horses, hikers, yachts); and across a range of taxonomic groups.

In order to measure the subconscious effects of trees on place perception, a two-group online survey was carried out that simulated different greening scenarios. The empirical results indicated positive effects of trees on the perceived esthetics and characteristics of urban squares, such as city image, worth to stay there, cleanness, and shopping atmosphere. We show that the assumed price level in adjacent restaurants as well as the willingness to visit, in terms of the willingness to stay in an urban square (i.e., the desired duration of visit) and the willingness to revisit it (i.e., the desired frequency of visit), are positively influenced by the presence of trees.

Yet, underlying factors enabling ES values are still poorly understood. We assume the production of ES value crucial for environmental stewardship in cities, and aimed in this study to uncover their key enabling factors. This study has been developed on a broad data base including a survey (n = 201), interviews (n = 46), field observation and remote sensing from 27 urban gardens in Barcelona, Spain, including municipal 'allotment gardens' and 'civic gardens' emerging from bottom-up initiatives. In a first step, we distinguished different urban gardens types regarding the ES values they provide. In a second step, we tested specific garden characteristics including (a) user profiles, (b) biophysical garden properties, and (c) institutional settings for their specific importance to trigger ES values. Results showed ES values to significantly differ with the types of gardens. For example, classical allotment gardens are more likely to provide recreational values, while emerging civic gardens are more likely to produce place-making and social cohesion. A main finding from our study is the importance of social and institutional garden characteristic as enabling factors of ES values. Results indicate, for example, a correlation between childhood experiences and a higher appreciation of ES. Our results further indicate that civic gardens with broader property rights and decision-capacities are more likely to enhance stewardship action. In providing a differentiated understanding of the ES value(s) of urban gardens, this study highlights the potential for green space planning in cities to steer the stewardship of urban gardens by providing institutional and physical space for civic gardening initiatives.},

The hedonic pricing method examines external benefits and costs of urban forests associated with housing. This investigation studied whether and how urban forest benefits are capitalized in property prices. It also searches for suitable variables for describing the green space benefits in hedonic pricing studies. Apartment sales data (1006 apartments) were collected in Joensuu, a town of 48000 inhabitants in North Carelia, Finland. Hedonic models were designed to explain purchase prices. Apartment characteristics, location, and environmental quality variables were used as explanatory variables in the models. Environmental and locality data were measured with respect to each specific house. Results indicate that urban forests are an appreciated environmental characteristic and that their benefits are reflected in the property prices Proximity of watercourses and wooded recreation areas as well as increasing proportion of total forested area in the housing district had a positive influence on apartment price. However, the effect of small forest parks was not clear. The range of the variable values was small, because there were many small wooded green spaces in the study locale. In addition, data concerning the views from the apartment or the composition of the forests was not available.},

  abstract = {Rhynchophorus palm weevils are large insects belonging to the family Dryophthoridae. All Rhynchophorus species are polyphagous and have a similar life history but some are major pests because of the serious economic damage they cause, in particular to several species of the family Arecaceae. Here we review the natural enemies of Rhynchophorus species in both their native and introduced regions of the world, to assess the possibility of biological control of this taxon. Moreover, particular attention is paid to the well-studied and harmful species Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, about which more information is available, and to its natural enemies in the Mediterranean region, because the impact of this pest in this recently colonized area is particularly remarkable and also the recent trend in species management is looking for indigenous natural enemies.More than 50 natural enemies have been reported to attack Rhynchophorus species, even if most of them are associated to R. ferrugineus (Olivier), highlighting the lack of information on the other species of the genus. Pros and cons of all the biological control agents are then discussed: among the considered organisms, fungi are noteworthy to be considered for inclusion in integrated pest management programs.Overall, our overview underlines the need to increase knowledge on natural enemies of all the species of the genus Rhynchophorus, to isolate more virulent strains and to determine the optimum conditions for the actions of the biocontrol agents. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.Globalization is triggering an increase in the establishment of alien insects in Europe, with several species having substantial ecological and economic impacts. We investigated long-term changes in rates of species spread following establishment. We used the total area of countries invaded by 1171 insect species for which the date of first record in Europe is known, to estimate their current range radius (calculated as [invaded area]0.5/$\pi$). We estimated initial rates of radial spread and compared them among different groups of insects for all years (1800\textendash{}2014) and for a subset of more recent decades (1950\textendash{}2014). Accidentally introduced species spread faster than intentionally introduced species. Considering the whole period 1800\textendash{}2014, spread patterns also differ between feeding guilds, with decreasing spread rates over residence time in herbivores but not in detritivores or parasitic species. These decreases for herbivorous species appeared mainly in those associated with herbaceous plants and crops rather than woody plants. Initial spread rate was significantly greater for species detected after 1990, roughly 3\textendash{}4 times higher than for species that arrived earlier. We hypothesize that the political changes in Europe following the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1989, and the further dismantling of customs checkpoints within an enlarged European Union (EU) have facilitated the faster spread of alien insect species. Also, the number of species first recorded in the Eastern Bloc of the politically-divided Europe before 1989 was lower than for the rest of Europe. A detailed analysis of six recent invaders indicated a dominant role of long-distance translocations related to human activities, especially with the plant trade, in determining rates of spread.},

  abstract = {The incidence of dengue has been on the rise since at least the 1960s, bringing greater urgency to the need for a vaccine to prevent the disease. Recent advances suggest that the scientific world is moving closer to an effective dengue vaccine. However, there are concerns that the price of a future vaccine could limit its uptake. High prices, in addition to other challenges, have already weighed negatively in government decisions to include other new vaccines in national immunization programs, e.g., the pneumococcal, rotavirus, and human papillomavirus vaccines. Recent research on the value of vaccination, however, suggests that vaccination confers benefits that are often neglected by traditional economic evaluations. In the case of dengue, commonly overlooked benefits are likely to include reduced spending on outbreak control, averted losses in tourism flows, and avoided productivity losses due to long-term dengue sequelae. Accounting for these and other broader benefits of dengue vaccination could reveal significantly greater economic value and strengthen the case for inclusion of dengue vaccination in national immunization programs. In this article we discuss a framework for the broader value of vaccination and review its application in the context of dengue vaccination for Brazil. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract Purpose \textendash{} The purpose of this paper is to investigate how chocolate lovers balance taste and ethical considerations when selecting chocolate products. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} The data set was collected through a survey at the 2014 " Salon du Chocolat " in Brussels, Belgium. The authors distributed 700 copies and received 456 complete responses (65 percent response rate). Choice experiments were used to estimate the relative importance of different chocolate characteristics and to predict respondents' willingness to pay for marginal changes in those characteristics. The authors estimate both a conditional logit model and a latent class model to take possible preference heterogeneity into account. Findings \textendash{} On average, respondents were willing to pay 11 euros more for 250 g fairtrade labeled chocolate compared to conventional chocolate. However, taste clearly dominates ethical considerations. The authors could distinguish three consumer segments, each with a different tradeoff between taste and fairtrade. One group clearly valued fairtrade positively, a second group valued fairtrade to a lesser extent and a third group did not seem to value fairtrade. Originality/value \textendash{} Chocolate can be seen as a self-indulgent treat where taste is likely to dominate other characteristics. Therefore it is unsure to what extent ethical factors are included in consumer decisions. Interestingly the results indicate that a significant share of chocolate buyers still positively value fairtrade characteristics when selecting chocolate varieties.},

We corrected for underreporting by using setting-specific expansion factors. Work absenteeism because of a dengue episode exceeded the absenteeism for an episode of influenza or acute otitis media. From 2002 to 2010, the aggregate annual cost of dengue illness averaged \$38.7 million, of which 70\% was for adults (age 15+ years). Hospitalized patients accounted for 63\% of the cost of dengue illness, and fatal cases represented an additional 17\%. Households funded 48\% of dengue illness cost, the government funded 24\%, insurance funded 22\%, and employers funded 7\%. Including dengue surveillance and vector control activities, the overall annual cost of dengue was \$46.45 million (\$12.47 per capita).},

  abstract = {The accelerating rates of international trade, travel, and transport in the latter half of the twentieth century have led to the progressive mixing of biota from across the world and the number of species introduced to new regions continues to increase. The importance of biogeographic, climatic, economic, and demographic factors as drivers of this trend is increasingly being realized but as yet there is no consensus regarding their relative importance. Whereas little may be done to mitigate the effects of geography and climate on invasions, a wider range of options may exist to moderate the impacts of economic and demographic drivers. Here we use the most recent data available from Europe to partition between macroecological, economic, and demographic variables the variation in alien species richness of bryophytes, fungi, vascular plants, terrestrial insects, aquatic invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Only national wealth and human population density were statistically significant predictors in the majority of models when analyzed jointly with climate, geography, and land cover. The economic and demographic variables reflect the intensity of human activities and integrate the effect of factors that directly determine the outcome of invasion such as propagule pressure, pathways of introduction, eutrophication, and the intensity of anthropogenic disturbance. The strong influence of economic and demographic variables on the levels of invasion by alien species demonstrates that future solutions to the problem of biological invasions at a national scale lie in mitigating the negative environmental consequences of human activities that generate wealth and by promoting more sustainable population growth.},

  abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that the level of threats to forests and vegetation will increase in the 21st century. Rising temperatures, drought, forest fires, heavy rains, humidity and cyclones will render forests and vegetation more prone to many threats, including pests and diseases. Pests and diseases adapted to warmer conditions would extend their distribution to the southern direction and higher elevations in Australia. Drought stressed plants may become more susceptible to existing pests and diseases, including bark beetles and Phytophthora spp. A range of exotic pests and diseases, if introduced, may cause widespread damage in Australia. Managing sustainable productivity inter alia requires realistic evaluation of impacts of climate change on potential threats to forests and the ecosystem services they provide, including as a carbon sink. Such evaluations of threats will assist future planning including prudent use of silvicultural practices to mitigate possible threats. Climate models can enable: better understanding of future threats to Australia's forests and vegetation and related ecosystem services; and better preparedness to safeguard Australia's natural resources in a changing climate. Forest management systems and plans can incorporate measures for mitigating the changing risks associated with pests, diseases, weeds, drought and fire. They can include contingency plans for the emergency salvage of damaged or dead standing timber to prevent damaged forest stands from becoming a source of greenhouse gas emissions. \textcopyright{} 2010 New Zealand Forest Research Institute Limited, trading as Scion.},

This discussion paper addresses revisions to assessing data quality captured in a new US Environmental Protection Agency guidance document as well as additional recommen-dations on data quality creation, management, and use in LCA databases and studies. Approach Existing data quality systems and approaches in LCA were reviewed and tested. The evaluations resulted in a revision to a commonly used pedigree matrix, for which flow and process level data quality indicators are described, more clarity for scoring criteria, and further guidance on interpreta-tion are given. Discussion Increased training for practitioners on data quality application and its limits are recommended. A multi-faceted approach to data quality assessment utilizing the pedigree method alongside uncertainty analysis in result interpretation is recommended. A method of data quality score aggregation is proposed and recommendations for usage of data quality scores in existing data are made to enable improved use of data quality scores in LCA results interpretation. Roles for data generators, data repositories, and data users are described in LCA data quality management. Guidance is provided on using data with data quality scores from other systems along-side data with scores from the new system. The new pedigree matrix and recommended data quality aggregation procedure can now be implemented in openLCA software. Future work Additional ways in which data quality assess-ment might be improved and expanded are described. Interoperability efforts in LCA data should focus on descrip-tors to enable user scoring of data quality rather than transla-tion of existing scores. Developing and using data quality indicators for additional dimensions of LCA data, and auto-mation of data quality scoring through metadata extraction and comparison to goal and scope are needed.},

One attractive nonchemical management approach for agricultural pests relies upon biological control by natural enemies. By improving the habitat of natural enemies of invasive agricultural pests, biological pest control can become privately attractive. This study develops a spatial optimization model to explore economically optimal spatial configuration of natural enemy habitat in agricultural landscapes. The model is applied to the management of soybean aphid (Aphis glycines), a recent invasive pest species of soybean production systems in the North Central region of the United States. Results indicate that non-crop habitat management can be a promising pest management option for organic cropping systems. Under current prices, however, habitat management tends to reduce net returns for conventional farms. Both area and configuration of non-crop habitats affect economic performance, with the greatest value coming from small, scattered areas of habitat. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

But invasive species risk assessments are time consuming, data intensive and expensive. Consequently, resource poor nations cannot implement these schemes. Here we develop a method for creating watch lists using the consistent predictors of invasion success\textemdash{}history of invasion, environmental suitability, and propagule pressure (measured respectively using the Global Invasive Species Database (GISD), environmental modelling, and tourism and trade data). We tested the approach for South Africa, at a national level for various taxa and at a provincial level for plants. Of 884 alien species listed in the GISD, 400 were potential invaders, with most occurring in high risk regions. When alien species in South Africa were evaluated there were many false-negatives (sensitivity of 32\% for terrestrial and 40\% for marine species), because the GISD is not comprehensive, but few false positives (specificity of 91\% for terrestrial and 89\% for marine species). The methodology was easy to apply at different political levels, but we found substantial overlaps between the national and provincial watch lists of plants. This simple technique is rapid, easily repeatable, flexible, transparent, works across taxa, and does not require substantial financial or scientific input. It can be used in any region of the world and at various political levels as an initial assessment of key threats. As such it may be an important step in developing biosecurity schemes for resource poor regions.},

There are two main outcomes of this study: (1) first, we developed and tested a catalogue of indicators as an approach to evaluate cultural ecosystem services trends at the local scale and (2) we established a mapping method for cultural ecosystem services trends in parallel with land use changes. This we did following the example of the afforestation processes which had taken place since the 19th century in the suburban area of G\"ottingen (Lower Saxony/Germany), called Hainberg. Our main conclusion is that cultural ecosystem services trends can indicate the reasons and drivers for land use changes that can be beneficial to forest/landscape management issues by means of the restoration of lost services. The proposed assessment method can be integrated into the development of future landscape plans, e.g. by providing information on historical guiding principles.},

  abstract = {Drosophila suzukii ovoposits and feeds on healthy fruits, unlike most other Drosophila species. It has been traditionally reported from Asia, but in the last 2 years it has been recorded from North America, where it is causing a lot of agricultural damage. Herein we report the first records of, D. suzukii in Europe. It has been found in different localities expanding an altitudinal range from 27 to 1550 m above sea level (ab.s.l). Furthermore by comparing collections of drosophilids from different European populations distributed along a latitudinal cline we were able to determine its high dispersal ability since it spread approximately 1400 km in 1 year either actively or passively through infested fruits. The similarities of the introduction dates in North America and Europe and the COI haplotypes suggest that the two invasions could be related. No considerable damage on crops has been reported yet in Europe. However, if this species gets established in more temperate localities it could become a serious pest. Therefore tracking the invasion of this species is recommended. An early detection of this potential pest is decisive for good management of the fields.},

At present, the alien species represent 39\% of the total whitefl y fauna and 36\% of the total adelgid fauna occuring in Europe. Th e proportion is insignifi cant in the other groups. Th e arrival of alien phylloxerans and adelgids appeared to peak during the fi rst part of the 20th century. In contrast, the mean number of new records per year of alien aleyrodids, psylloids and Auchenorrhyncha increased regularly after the 1950s. For these three groups, an average of 0.5\textendash{}0.6 new alien species has been recorded per year in Europe since 2000. Th e region of origin of the alien species largely diff ers between the diff erent groups. Alien aleyrodids and psylloids mainly originated from tropical regions whilst the adelgids and phylloxerans came equally from Northfrom North American. Most of these alien species are presently observed in man-made habitats, especially in parks and gardens but alien adelgids are mainly observed in forests because of their association with conifer trees used for aff orestation.},

Besides this, the indirect losses would increase this several fold. Further, we also estimated the saving due to curative treatment of palms in the early stage of attack at the above infestation levels to range from \$20.73 to \$103.66 million, respectively. Considering the severity of the loss and also the loss saved, it is suggested that countries in the region strengthen the on-going management programmes against this lethal pest.},

Urban trees are an important aspect of the urban environment but there is little known about the potential sources of those trees, change in tree species diversity over time and the factors leading to the contemporary floristic composition in cities. We investigate tree nursery offerings in Los Angeles County over the past 110 years through the use of here-to-fore unexplored nursery catalogs to determine the diversity of trees that have been commercially available over time. Tree species information was collected spanning a 110-year study period and analyzed the data for four time periods (1900-1929, 1930-1959, 1960-1989, and 1990-2011). We found the number of genera and tree species offered significantly increased in the past 20 years (1990-2011). The numbers of non-native trees, angiosperms, and deciduous species all significantly increased with but no changes were observed in the numbers of native, evergreen, or gymnosperm species offered over this time period. The largest numbers of palm species were offered in 1900-1929. Overall there were 562 unique species offered belonging to 201 different genera in the 120-year study period, 48 species were California native trees and 514 of these were non-native species indicating that perhaps Los Angeles has one of the most diverse number of tree species offered for sale by the nursery industry. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Several ecosystem service estimation studies have been conducted acting upon the assumption that relationships developed elsewhere are applicable to sites that vary in species, site, climate, and environmental conditions. This study tested the accuracy of highly used existing leaf area and biomass models when used outside the region in which it was developed. To do this, we measured 74 urban trees from five species in Stevens Point, Wisconsin collecting data such as diameter at breast height (Dbh), tree height, height to the base of live crown, crown width, crown volume, leaf area, and leaf dry weight biomass. Using the data, we developed two models each to predict leaf area and biomass. Using ten independent samples, we compared our predictions with predictions from the existing models which are also used in i-Tree. Our results indicated that the local models developed in the current study predicted leaf area and biomass better than existing models which had higher prediction error. The difference in prediction will ultimately affect ecosystem services estimation when. using i-Tree, and future studies should acknowledge the difference.},

  abstract = {$\backslash$textlessp$\backslash$textgreaterWe tested whether two basic thermal requirements for insect development, lower developmental thresholds, i.e. temperatures at which development ceases, and sums of effective temperatures, i.e. numbers of day degrees above the lower developmental thresholds necessary to complete development, differ among insect species that proved to be successful invaders in regions outside their native range and those that did not. Focusing on species traits underlying invasiveness that are related to temperature provides insights into the mechanisms of insect invasions. The screening of thermal requirements thus could improve risk-assessment schemes by incorporating these traits in predictions of potentially invasive insect species. We compared 100 pairs of taxonomically-related species originating from the same continent, one invasive and the other not reported as invasive. Invasive species have higher lower developmental thresholds than those never recorded outside their native ranges. Invasive species also have a lower sum of effective temperatures, though not significantly. However, the differences between invasive and non-invasive species in the two physiological measures were significantly inversely correlated. This result suggests that many species are currently prevented from invading by low temperatures in some parts of the world. Those species that will overcome current climatic constraints in regions outside their native distribution due to climate change could become even more serious future invaders than present-day species, due to their potentially faster development.$\backslash$textless/p$\backslash$textgreater},

For 431 species (27\%), the pathway is unknown. T e unaided pathway, describing leading-edge dispersal of an alien species to a new region from a donor region where it is also alien, is expected to be common for arthropods in conti- nental Europe, although not precisely documented in the data. Selected examples are given for each path- way. T e spatiotemporal signal in the relevance of pathways and vectors and implications for alien species management and policy options are also discussed. Identifying and tackling pathways is considered an important component of any strategy to reduce propagule pressure of the often small and unintentionally translocated, mega-diverse arthropods.

Costs were calculated for the period 2000-2002 in three pilot areas of Santiago de Cuba where a community intervention was implemented and compared with three control areas with routine vertical programme activities. Reduction in A. aegypti foci was chosen as the measure of effectiveness. The pre-intervention number of foci (614 vs. 632) and economical costs for vector control (US\$243 746 vs. US\$263 486) were comparable in the intervention and control areas. During the intervention period (2001-2002), a 13\% decrease in recurrent costs for the health system was observed. Within the control areas, these recurrent relative costs remained stable. The number of A. aegypti foci in the pilot areas and the control areas fell by 459 and 467, respectively. The community-based approach was more cost effective from a health system perspective (US\$964 vs. US\$1406 per focus) as well as from society perspective (US\$1508 vs. US\$1767 per focus). ?? 2007 Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.},

  abstract = {The relationship between temperature and the developmental rate of organisms is crucial for understanding a variety of biological processes. It is common to use an average-based index of temperature, for example degree-days, for examining the relationship; and relatively little attention has been given to the variance of temperature. In this study, we examined the importance of temperature fluctuation on the development of organisms by compiling published studies. Published studies have shown highly variable results where the developmental rate was sometimes higher and sometimes lower under static temperature compared with variable temperature. A laboratory experiment on Megaselia scalaris showed that M. scalaris developed faster under fluctuating temperature than static temperature. We tested an additive model to predict the effect of fluctuating temperature on development and found that the model was inadequate for making quantitative predictions. However, some qualitative predictions, for example temperature fluctuation has a positive or negative effect, can be successfully predicted by the additive model. Our results show that the effect of temperature on developmental rate is not completely additive and average-based indices such as degree-days cannot be used when quantitative predictions are required.},

  abstract = {Red palm weevil, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) is a key pest of date palm Phoenix dactylifera L and continues to spread among and within date palm plantation countries. Globally, R. ferrugineus has the widest geographical range among the genus of Rhynchophorus weevils and is known to cause complete destruction of palms often resulting in widespread damage to entire grooves of cultivated date palms. Since R. ferrugineus was first recognized as a threat to date palm production in the mid 1980s for GCC countries, scientists and growers have deployed several methods to control this destructive pest, with the use of chemical insecticides being the main strategy until the synthesis of the male aggregation pheromone in 1993. This article reviews the current literature on different control methods to evaluate the effectiveness of various control options and proposes an overall strategy to manage R. ferrugineus in date palm. The R. ferrugineus control methods include prospects of early detection techniques, role of phyto-sanitation and agro-techniques (palm and field sanitation, palm injury prevention, elimination of hidden breeding sites including abandoned date plantations), semiochemicals and insecticide applications in preventive and curative treatments. Further, case studies of area-wide R. ferrugineus management in date palm besides the potential of biological control methods particularly with regard to the use of entomopathogenic fungi and nematodes and also the role of regulatory methods to regulate transport and transfer of infested palm trees (domestic and international quarantine) is presented. A review of the available control methodologies suggests that R. ferrugineus can be managed by deploying an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy comprising of several tactics including regulatory methods, behaviour manipulation involving insect aggregation pheromones for monitoring and mass trapping adult weevils, chemical and biological control, crop and field sanitation, eliminating hidden breeding sites, manipulation of cultural practices involving in-groove humidity and palm density, frond and offshoot removal, besides regular dissemination of R. ferrugineus-IPM technologies among farmers and pest managers.},

  abstract = {The imported fire ant has become a major economic pest to various sectors of the Texas economy. In order to determine the economic impact of this pest on selected urban areas, an economic study was conducted in 1998-1999 in the 5 metroplexes of Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio and Houston to estimate the costs of controlling and managing fire ants. The main purpose of this study was to estimate the annual economic impact of the fire ant on the households, schools, cities, and golf courses for the aforementioned metroplexes. Other sectors within the urban areas are affected but this study shows the major impacted sectors that interfere with the human activities in living areas, work areas and recreational areas. Annual expenditures for the management and control of fire ants was selected as an indicator of the annual economic impact. This study found that the annual expenditure for fire ant control and management in these metroplexes amounted to over \$581 million. The total annual expense by sector amounted to \$526 million for households, \$29 million for golf courses, \$25 million for schools, and \$0.6 million for cities. These annual cost figures do not include multiple family housing or costs born by electrical utility companies, communication firms and cable companies. These data are available from the Texas Tech University study conducted by E. Segarra, et.al. The annual costs of control and management of fire ants were distributed by metroplex as follows: \$61 million for Austin, \$121.5 million for Dallas, \$74.9 million for Fort Worth, \$121.9 million for Houston and \$202 million for San Antonio. The costs by expenditure items were as follows: \$301.5 million for fire ant control and treatment, \$80.6 million for repairs, \$152 million for costs of equipment replacement and \$47.2 million for medical treatment. The study also revealed information about location of damaged areas, respondents' valuation of the activities curtailed by fire ants and their willingness to pay for effective fire ant management.},

  abstract = {Megacities contain at least 10 million people whose wellbeing largely depends on ecosystem services provided by remote natural areas. What is, however, most often disregarded is that nature conservation in the city can also contribute to human wellbeing benefits. The most common mind set separates cities from the rest of nature, as if they were not special kinds of natural habitats. Instead, awareness that urban systems are also nature and do host biodiversity and ecosystem services opportunities, should push urban people towards increased urban forest conservation and implementation strategies. This research estimated existing and potential, tree cover, and its contribution to ecosystem services in 10 megacity metropolitan areas, across 5 different continents and biomes. We developed estimates for each megacity using local data to transform i-Tree Eco estimates of tree cover benefits to reductions in air pollution, stormwater, building energy, and carbon emissions for London, UK. The transformation used biophysical scaling equations based on local megacity tree cover, human population, air pollution, climate, energy use, and purchasing power parity. The megacity metropolitan areas ranged from 1173 to 18,720 sq km (median value 2530 sq km), with median tree cover 21\%, and potential tree cover another 19\% of the city. Megacities had a median tree cover density of 39 m2/capita, much smaller than the global average value of 7800 m2/capita, with density lower in desert and tropical biomes, and higher in temperate biomes. The present median benefit value from urban trees in all 10 megacities can be estimated as \$482 million/yr due to reductions in CO, NO2, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5, \$11 million/yr due to avoided stormwater processing by wastewater facilities, \$0.5 million/yr due to building energy heating and cooling savings, and \$8 million/yr due to CO2sequestration. Planting more trees in potential tree cover areas could nearly double the benefits provided by the urban forest. In 2016 there were 40 megacities, totaling 722 million residents, nearly 10\% of the human population, who would benefit from nature conservation plans where they work and live. Nature conservation strategies in megacities should work to sustain and grow the benefits of the urban forest, and improve accounting methods to include additional ecosystem services provided by the urban forest.},

The need to avoid economic losses because of insect pest populations is one of the greatest challenges faced by this sector. Insect pests have caused annual losses of US\$12.0 billion to the Brazilian economy, of which approximately US\$1.6 billion are because of exotic pest species. Furthermore, exotic insect species often show greater potential to cause harm than native species. In Brazil, since the late nineteenth century, 24 species of insect pests have been introduced into the country, and they have caused significant economic losses. Many of these species, including Bemisia tabaci, Hypothenemus hampei, Ceratitis capitata, Oryzophagus oryzae and Anthonomus grandis, are major crop pests, and they were accidentally introduced during trading of agricultural products. In this review, we present an overview of Brazilian agriculture, a brief history of the introduction of insect pests in the country and the Brazilian legislation on agricultural defence, and we estimate the economic losses caused to the Brazilian economy by the main insect pest species that have been introduced into Brazil over the last 112 years.},

This work demonstrates a quantitative method for exploring priority planting and ecosystem service tradeoffs in Baltimore, Maryland using spatially explicit biophysical iTree models. Several planting schemes were created based on the individual optimization of a number of metrics related to services and benefits of air pollution and heat mitigation ecosystem services. The results demonstrate that different tree planting schemes would be pursued based on the ecosystem service or benefit maximized, revealing tradeoffs between services and priority planting locations. With further development including consideration of additional ecosystem services, disservices, user input, and costs of tree planting and maintenance, this approach could provide city planners, urban foresters, and members of the public with a powerful tool to better manage urban forest systems.},

For example, to combat the current Zika outbreak the US President requested the allocation of \$1.8 billion from Congress in February 2016.$\backslash$backslashn$\backslash$backslashnMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Illustrated through an interactive tool, we evaluated how the number of Zika cases averted, the period during pregnancy in which Zika infection poses a risk of microcephaly, and probabilities of microcephaly and Guillain-Barr\'e Syndrome (GBS) impact the cost at which an intervention is cost-effective. From Northeast Brazilian microcephaly incidence data, we estimated the probability of microcephaly in infants born to Zika-infected women (0.49\% to 2.10\%). We also estimated the probability of GBS arising from Zika infections in Brazil (0.02\% to 0.06\%) and Colombia (0.08\%). We calculated that each microcephaly and GBS case incurs the loss of 29.95 DALYs and 1.25 DALYs per case, as well as direct medical costs for Latin America and the Caribbean of \$91,102 and \$28,818, respectively. We demonstrated the utility of our cost-effectiveness tool with examples evaluating funding commitments by Costa Rica and Brazil, the US presidential proposal, and the novel approach of genetically modified mosquitoes. Our analyses indicate that the commitments and the proposal are likely to be cost-effective, whereas the cost-effectiveness of genetically modified mosquitoes depends on the country of implementation.$\backslash$backslashn$\backslash$backslashnCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Current estimates from our tool suggest that the health burden from microcephaly and GBS warrants substantial expenditures focused on Zika virus control. Our results justify the funding committed in Costa Rica and Brazil and many aspects of the budget outlined in the US president's proposal. As data continue to be collected, new parameter estimates can be customized in real-time within our user-friendly tool to provide updated estimates on cost-effectiveness of interventions and inform policy decisions in country-specific settings.},

Aliens to Europe belong to fi ve families, but four-fi fths of them are from the Curculionidae. Many families and subfamilies, including some species-rich ones, have few representatives among alien curculionoids, whereas some others are over-represented; these latter, Dryophthoridae, Cossoninae and specially Scolyti- nae, all contain many xylophagous species. T e number of new records of alien species increases continu- ously, with an acceleration during the last decades. Aliens to Europe originate from all parts of the world, but mainly Asia; few alien curculionoids originate from Africa. Italy and France host the largest number of alien to Europe. T e number of aliens per country decreases eastwards, but is mainly correlated with importations frequency and, secondarily, with climate. All alien curculionoids have been introduced acci- dentally via international shipping. Wood and seed borers are specially liable to human-mediated dispersal due to their protected habitat. Alien curculionoids mainly attack stems, and half of them are xylophagous. T e majority of alien curculionoids live in human-modifi ed habitats, but many species live in forests and other natural or semi-natural habitats. Several species are pests, among which grain feeders as Sitophilus spp. are the most damaging.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0024733},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The establishment rate of invasive alien insect species has been increasing worldwide during the past century. This trend has been widely attributed to increased rates of international trade and associated species introductions, but rarely linked to environmental change. To better understand and manage the bioinvasion process, it is crucial to understand the relationship between global warming and establishment rate of invasive alien species, especially for poikilothermic invaders such as insects.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present data that demonstrate a significant positive relationship between the change in average annual surface air temperature and the establishment rate of invasive alien insects in mainland China during 1900-2005. This relationship was modeled by regression analysis, and indicated that a 1 $^\circ$C increase in average annual surface temperature in mainland China was associated with an increase in the establishment rate of invasive alien insects of about 0.5 species year$^{-}^1$. The relationship between rising surface air temperature and increasing establishment rate remained significant even after accounting for increases in international trade during the period 1950-2005. Moreover, similar relationships were detected using additional data from the United Kingdom and the contiguous United States.\$$\backslash$backslash\$n\$$\backslash$backslash\$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that the perceived increase in establishments of invasive alien insects can be explained only in part by an increase in introduction rate or propagule pressure. Besides increasing propagule pressure, global warming is another driver that could favor worldwide bioinvasions. Our study highlights the need to consider global warming when designing strategies and policies to deal with bioinvasions.},

Fourteen species have been added to the list in the past 44 years; 10 have larger distributions and 4 have no reported change in distribution, and 3 species are no longer considered invasive. Although most research has focused on invasive termites in urban areas, molecular identification methods have answered questions about certain species and found that at least six species have invaded natural forest habitats. All invasive species share three characteristics that together increase the probability of creating viable propagules: they eat wood, nest in food, and easily generate secondary reproductives. These characteristics are most common in two families, the Kalotermitidae and Rhinotermitidae (which make up 21 species on the invasive termite list), particularly in three genera, Cryptotermes, Heterotermes, and Coptotermes (which together make up 16 species). Although it is the largest termite family, the Termitidae (comprising 70\% of all termite species) have only two invasive species, because relatively few species have these characteristics. Islands have double the number of invasive species that continents do, with islands in the South Pacific the most invaded geographical region. Most invasive species originate from Southeast Asia. The standard control methods normally used against native pest termites are also employed against invasive termites; only two eradication attempts, in South Africa and New Zealand, appear to have been successful, both against Coptotermes species.},

  doi = {10.1007/s10530-016-1291-2},
  abstract = {Climate change has been conclusively linked to species extinctions, and to expansion and contractions and shifts of species ranges. Climate change is exerting similarly profound pressures on the individual stages of biological invasion which can significantly impact the biodiversity and ecology of invaded areas. Propagule pressure is perhaps the single most important determinant of invasion success, but the effects of climate change on propagule pressure are still largely uncertain because we have few observations of introduction events (or their size) that can be analyzed together with climate records. The common surrogate variables for propagule pressure do not logically respond to climate. Here I use a process-based simulation model to examine the potential effects of climate change (specifically temperature) on propagule size of a common invading insect species by estimating in-transit survivorship rate of propagules using historical and future (projected) temperatures and two common trade routes between a donor and a recipient location (Yokohama, Japan and Sydney, Australia). Propagule size (=the number of individuals in an introduction event) was lower under climate change temperatures than under historical temperatures in both routes. The route had significant effects on propagule size through its influence on the duration (and also the timing) of exposure to temperature conditions that are of time-sensitive importance to the development of the invasive species. Under historical temperatures propagule size was higher and less variable in the direct than the indirect route in 20 independent iterations. Under the future temperatures propagule size was also higher in the direct route but it was more variable than in the indirect route. Increased trade is increasing the opportunities for introductions, but the results reported here suggest that climate change will have inconsistent effects on biological invasion because of the complex relationship between temperature and insect ontogeny.},

  abstract = {The recorded world distribution of Trogoderma granarium is reviewed. Using these records an attempt is made to assess its pest status in different countries. Three sets of climatic requirements suggested by previous workers for predicting the distribution of the species are evaluated. These climatic criteria were (1) a mean monthly temperature over 20$^\circ$C for at least 4 consecutive months, (2) a mean monthly temperature over 20$^\circ$C and a mean r.h. of over 50\% for at least 4 consecutive months, and (3) a mean monthly temperature of over 27$^\circ$C and a mean r.h. of over 75\% for over one month. Areas of the world corresponding to criterion (2) were found to correlate largely with the occurrence of T. granarium as a major pest in unheated environments as predicted by Howe and Lindgren (1957). However, in areas with a prolonged high average temperature a slightly higher mean r.h. limit may prove more appropriate for predicting the pest status of this species. T. granarium is absent from Australia though some parts are apparently climatically suitable. This is discussed in relation to the factors influencing the establishment of exotic stored product pests and the relevance of average meteorological data to stored product pest distributions. It is concluded that climatic factors at the ports may have prevented the establishment and subsequent transport of sufficient numbers to more climatically favourable areas inland. Prevailing temperatures at the ports appear adequate for T. granarium but the high relative humidity there seems to be the main controlling factor. This factor may act indirectly on T. granarium by favouring other species which compete with it. \textcopyright{} 1977.},

  abstract = {Estimates of air pollution removal by the urban forest have mostly been based on mean values of forest structure variables for an entire city. However, the urban forest is not uniformly distributed across a city because of biophysical and social factors. Consequently, air pollution removal function by urban vegetation should vary because of this spatial heterogeneity. This paper presents a different approach to evaluate how the spatial heterogeneity of the urban forest influences air pollution removal at the socioeconomic subregion scale. Air pollution removal for July 1997 to June 1998 and July 2000 to June 2001 were estimated using measured urban forest structure data from three socioeconomic subregions in Santiago, Chile. Dry deposition was estimated using hourly climate, mixing height, and pollutant concentration data. Pollution removal rates among the three socioeconomic subregions were different because of heterogeneous urban forest structure and pollution concentrations. Air pollution removal per square meter of tree cover was greatest in the low socioeconomic subregion. Pollution removal during 1997-1998 was different from 2000 to 2001 due to pollution concentration differences. Seasonal air quality improvement also differed among the subregions. Results can be used to design management alternatives at finer administrative scales such as districts and neighborhoods that maximize the pollution removal rates by the urban forest in a subregion. Policies that affect the functionality of urban forest structure must consider spatial heterogeneity and scale when making region-wide recommendations. Similarly, when modeling the functionality of the urban forest, models must capture this spatial heterogeneity for inter-city comparisons. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The growing human population concentrated in urban areas lead to the increase of road traffic and artificial areas, consequently enhancing air pollution and urban heat island effects, among others. These environmental changes affect citizen's health, causing a high number of premature deaths, with considerable social and economic costs. Nature-based solutions are essential to ameliorate those impacts in urban areas. While the mere presence of urban green spaces is pointed as an overarching solution, the relative importance of specific vegetation structure, composition and management to improve the ecosystem services of air purification and climate regulation are overlooked. This avoids the establishment of optimized planning and management procedures for urban green spaces with high spatial resolution and detail. Our aim was to understand the relative contribution of vegetation structure, composition and management for the provision of ecosystem services of air purification and climate regulation in urban green spaces, in particular the case of urban parks. This work was done in a large urban park with different types of vegetation surrounded by urban areas. As indicators of microclimatic effects and of air pollution levels we selected different metrics: lichen diversity and pollutants accumulation in lichens. Among lichen diversity, functional traits related to nutrient and water requirements were used as surrogates of the capacity of vegetation to filter air pollution and to regulate climate, and provide air purification and climate regulation ecosystem services, respectively. This was also obtained with very high spatial resolution which allows detailed spatial planning for optimization of ecosystem services. We found that vegetation type characterized by a more complex structure (trees, shrubs and herbaceous layers) and by the absence of management (pruning, irrigation and fertilization) had a higher capacity to provide the ecosystems services of air purification and climate regulation. By contrast, lawns, which have a less complex structure and are highly managed, were associated to a lower capacity to provide these services. Tree plantations showed an intermediate effect between the other two types of vegetation. Thus, vegetation structure, composition and management are important to optimize green spaces capacity to purify air and regulate climate. Taking this into account green spaces can be managed at high spatial resolutions to optimize these ecosystem services in urban areas and contribute to improve human well-being.},

  abstract = {Since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, ecosystem service science has made much progress in framing core concepts and approaches, but there is still debate around the notion of cultural services, and a growing consensus that ecosystem use and ecosystem service use should be clearly differentiated. Part of the debate resides in the fact that the most significant sources of conflict around natural resource management arise from the multiple managements (uses) of ecosystems, rather than from the multiple uses of ecosystem services. If the ecosystem approach or the ecosystem service paradigm are to be implemented at national levels, there is an urgent need to disentangle what are often semantic issues, revise the notion of cultural services, and more broadly, practically define the less tangible ecosystem services on which we depend. This is a critical step to identifying suitable ways to manage trade-offs and promote adaptive management. Here we briefly review the problems associated with defining and quantifying cultural ecosystem services and suggest there could be merit in discarding this term for the simpler non-material ecosystem services. We also discuss the challenges in valuing the invaluable, and suggest that if we are to keep ecosystem service definition focused on the beneficiary, we need to further classify these challenging services, for example by differentiating services to individuals from services to communities. Also, we suggest that focussing on ecosystem service change rather than simply service delivery, and identifying common boundaries relevant for both people and ecosystems, would help meet some of these challenges.},

  abstract = {Niche-based models calibrated in the native range by relating species observations to climatic variables are commonly used to predict the potential spatial extent of species\~O invasion. This climate matching approach relies on the assumption that invasive species conserve their climatic niche in the invaded ranges. We test this assumption by analysing the climatic niche spaces of Spotted Knapweed in western North America and Europe. We show with robust cross-continental data that a shift of the observed climatic niche occurred between native and non-native ranges, providing the first empirical evidence that an invasive species can occupy climatically distinct niche spaces following its introduction into a new area. The models fail to predict the current invaded distribution, but correctly predict areas of introduction. Climate matching is thus a useful approach to identify areas at risk of introduction and establishment of newly or not-yet-introduced neophytes, but may not predict the full extent of invasions.},

@techreport{citeulike:14040392,
  title = {Ecological Services of Urban Forest in {{Barcelona}}},
  abstract = {[Excerpt: Summary]

Forests and urban trees generally offer multiple services and environmental benefits to society. These trees are distributed into different land uses (in our case, land uses are defined from the third edition of Mapa Ecol\`ogic de Barcelona, 2006), ranging from forest environments and gardens, to densely built areas or polluted urban environments. The structure, and consequently the composition, of urban forest vary in these different land uses, whether public or private. Trees, and the functions and services that they offer, such as air quality improvement, carbon sequestration or temperature reduction, are directly influenced by management and actions that affect its structure (composition of species, number and location of individuals...). Therefore, proper management of urban green spaces may increase the environmental benefits of trees present in our city. The first step to improve the management of urban forest is to evaluate their current structure and benefits.

[] On January 2009, began a study to quantify the effects of urban forest from different plots distributed throughout the entire city of Barcelona (including the areas of Montju\"ic and Collserola), going from the most natural to the most urbanized zones. This assessment was mainly analyzed with the UFORE model (Urban Forest Effects), a computer program able to evaluate the structure of urban forest, like the species composition, tree density and numerous derived functions, such as storage and carbon sequestration, pollution reduction, volatile organic compounds formation, as well as other important services.

[] [...] The report describes the structure of urban forest and the ecological benefits derived from this urban forest (shrubs and trees) of the city. Other environmental services such as noise pollution, water cycle and vulnerability of urban forest to the climate change, will be also treated.

[] [...]

[Conclusion] The vulnerability of urban vegetation to climate change is very difficult to quantify. However, in Barcelona's parks and gardens these changes could be mitigated by appropriate management. As well as increasing the permeable surface (which, as has been seen, is only 36\%) and the tree cover, the health of trees must be improved with specific watering and maintenance systems depending on the requirements of the species to promote tree growth, make them less vulnerable to drought, and improve the benefits they bring to the climate and pollution elimination. This must be accompanied by measures tending to make maintenance activities more sustainable.

[] This study, focusing on the environmental benefits of urban vegetation, has revealed very interesting results. However, in order to obtain other information, such as energy savings or which species best filter polluted air, it would have to be completed with ecophysiological studies, at least of the most abundant plant varieties in the city, as we already know that some species are more affected than others by warming and drought episodes. So, the choice of species through research and genetic selection could improve the state of the city's trees and ensure greater biodiversity, thereby reducing the risk from pests. Measures are also required to prevent the proliferation of invasive species in natural areas.

[] Due to Barcelona's great population density, the environmental services of the urban vegetation play a modest role; by contrast their social services, not included in this study, are more important, due to the need (biophilia) varying from person to person, to enjoy the presence of vegetation in streets, balconies, gardens, etc. and the improvements to the landscape this involves.},

  abstract = {The recorded world distribution of Trogoderma granarium is reviewed. Using these records an attempt is made to assess its pest status in different countries. Three sets of climatic requirements suggested by previous workers for predicting the distribution of the species are evaluated. These climatic criteria were (1) a mean monthly temperature over 20$^\circ$C for at least 4 consecutive months, (2) a mean monthly temperature over 20$^\circ$C and a mean r.h. of over 50\% for at least 4 consecutive months, and (3) a mean monthly temperature of over 27$^\circ$C and a mean r.h. of over 75\% for over one month. Areas of the world corresponding to criterion (2) were found to correlate largely with the occurrence of `I: granarium as a major pest in unheated environments as predicted by HOWEand LINDGRE(1N957).However,in areas with a prolonged high average temperature a slightly higher mean r.h. limit may prove more appropriate for predicting the pest status of this species. 7: granarium is absent from Australia though some parts are apparently climatically suitable. This is discussed in relation to the factors influencing the establishment of exotic stored product pests and the relevance of average meteorological data to stored product pest distributions. It is concluded that climatic factors at the ports may have prevented the establishment and subsequent transport of sufficient numbers to more climatically favourable areas inland. Prevailing temperatures at the ports appear adequate for T granarium but the high relative humidity there seems to be the main controlling factor. This factor may act indirectly on ?: granarium by favouring other species which compete with it.},

It has been traditionally reported from Asia, but in the last 2 years it has been recorded from North America, where it is causing a lot of agricultural damage. Herein we report the first records of, D. suzukii in Europe. It has been found in different localities expanding an altitudinal range from 27 to 1550 m above sea level (ab.s.l). Furthermore by comparing collections of drosophilids from different European populations distributed along a latitudinal cline we were able to determine its high dispersal ability since it spread approximately 1400 km in 1 year either actively or passively through infested fruits. The similarities of the introduction dates in North America and Europe and the COI haplotypes suggest that the two invasions could be related. No considerable damage on crops has been reported yet in Europe. However, if this species gets established in more temperate localities it could become a serious pest. Therefore tracking the invasion of this species is recommended. An early detection of this potential pest is decisive for good management of the fields.},

To ascertain the geographical distribution of T. peregrinus surveys were conducted between May and June 2012 at 53 sites in central and southern Portugal. T. peregrinus was present in only three sites, which were all located in Lisbon and surrounding areas suggesting an introduction pathway through the harbors or the airport in this coastal city. Of the 30 Eucalyptus species present in Lisbon's Eucalyptus arboretum, 14 were confirmed as infested by T. peregrinus during the first survey in April 2012.

During the study period, all stages of development were present at the same time, which made it difficult to determine the number of generations of each species. The evolution in the number of live insects on leaves or shoots was analysed, showing that Juda's tree psyllid population was was the first to appear (March) and disappear (July) from trees. Albizia, tipu and red gum lerp psyllids were present from April to August-September. The Ficus psyllid population was abundant on shoots from February to June, and its populations drastically decreased in July-August, but increased again in September. Predators and parasitoids associated with psyllids were Anthocoris nemoralis (a predator of psyllid species) and Prionomitus mitratus and Psyllaephagus bliteus (parasitoids of Ficus and red gum lerp psyllids, respectively).},

  abstract = {Of the 19,400 native species and 125 families forming the European diptera fauna, 98 species (less than 0.5\%) in 22 families are alien to Europe. These aliens constitute 66 species (18 families) of the suborder Brachycera and 32 species (4 families) of the suborder Nematocera. By family in this category, there are 23 Cecidomyiidae species, 18 Drosophilidae, nine Phoridae, eight Tachinidae and seven Culicidae. Another 32 fly species belonging to five families are considered to be alien in Europe. These invasives native to other European countries are composed of 14 species of Cecidomyiidae, seven Syrphidae, five Culicidae and three species each of Anthomyiidae and Tephritidae. The date of the first record in Europe is known for 84 alien species. Arrivals of alien species of Diptera have accelerated rapidly since the second half of the 20th century. North America appears to be the dominant contributor of the alien flies. The majority of alien Diptera were introduced into or within Europe unintentionally, with only three predators released intentionally for biological control. Alien Diptera are predominantly phytophagous (35.6\%), while a lesser portion are zoophagous (28.6\%) or detrivorous /mycetophagous (29.6\%). Ecological impacts on native fauna and flora have not been documented for any of the alien species established in Europe. However, 14 alien species have economic impacts on crops.},

It has settled in Catalonia (Spain), occupying at present an area of at least 44.1 km2, where it has been shown to severely infest (ca. 10 to 45\%) and eventually kill mulberry trees in private and public grounds. The main objective of this study was to evaluate its impact and provide new significant insights into its life history, seasonality, reproductive capacity (females produce an average of 83.4 $\pm$ 9.02 eggs) and the type of damage produced to mulberries. Such damage was thoroughly described to facilitate inspection by others. At least in laboratory conditions, X. chinensis has not used common grape vines as an alternative hostplant. Both plants, mulberries and grape vines, are important in Catalonia and Spain, the former providing shade and ornament to many streets and avenues, and the latter having great economic significance in Mediterranean wine production areas. Possible control methods to hinder its spread are suggested and one local wasp, Stephanus serrator (Stephanidae), was identified as a likely parasitoid. We believe the risk of this beetle widely spreading in Europe is very real.},

  abstract = {Many fungal plant diseases are strongly controlled by weather, and global climate change is thus likely to have affected fungal pathogen distributions and impacts. Modelling the response of plant diseases to climate change is hampered by the difficulty of estimating pathogen-relevant microclimatic variables from standard meteorological data. The availability of increasingly sophisticated high-resolution climate reanalyses may help overcome this challenge. We illustrate the use of climate reanalyses by testing the hypothesis that climate change increased the likelihood of the 2008-2011 outbreak of Coffee Leaf Rust (CLR, Hemileia vastatrix) in Colombia. We develop a model of germination and infection risk, and drive this model using estimates of leaf wetness duration and canopy temperature from the Japanese 55-Year Reanalysis (JRA-55). We model germination and infection as Weibull functions with different temperature optima, based upon existing experimental data. We find no evidence for an overall trend in disease risk in coffee-growing regions of Colombia from 1990 to 2015, therefore, we reject the climate change hypothesis. There was a significant elevation in predicted CLR infection risk from 2008 to 2011 compared with other years. JRA-55 data suggest a decrease in canopy surface water after 2008, which may have helped terminate the outbreak. The spatial resolution and accuracy of climate reanalyses are continually improving, increasing their utility for biological modelling. Confronting disease models with data requires not only accurate climate data, but also disease observations at high spatio-temporal resolution. Investment in monitoring, storage and accessibility of plant disease observation data are needed to match the quality of the climate data now available.This article is part of the themed issue 'Tackling emerging fungal threats to animal health, food security and ecosystem resilience'.},
